<p>A growing number of people who work in tech find themselves involved in
teaching and training, either on the job as they mentor new hires or after hours
as mentors in coding workshops and bootcamps. This intensive one-day workshop
helps them do this better by introducing them to a handful of practical,
evidence-based teaching practices. The workshop has been run over a hundred
times in various forms on five continents for non-profit organizations,
libraries, and companies, and all of the material is freely available online at
<a href="http://teachtogether.tech">http://teachtogether.tech</a>. Topics
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts;</li>
  <li>mental models, cognitive load, and how to design learnable lessons;</li>
  <li>teaching as a performance art;</li>
  <li>six practices to accelerate learning; and</li>
  <li>what motivates and demotivates adult learners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants need to bring a laptop or tablet that can connect to the
internet, a cell phone that can record a couple of minutes of audio and video, a
few sheets of paper, and something to write with.  For more information, please
<a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.
