I just posted 1500 words plus footnotes on the Software Carpentry site summarizing <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/2011/12/what-ive-learned-so-far/">what I've learned so far about online teaching</a>. The takeaways are:
<ol>
	<li>Online teaching isn't as effective as in-person teaching.</li>
	<li>Today's tools suck.</li>
	<li>If content is king, then community is queen, pope, emperor, and president-for-life.</li>
	<li>If you don't know how to tell if you succeeded, you're going to fail.</li>
	<li>If you don't take the time to explore what other people have done, you <em>deserve</em> to fail.</li>
</ol>
I'd welcome commentsâ€¦
