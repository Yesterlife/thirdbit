Following up on <a href="/blog/archives/4256.html">Wednesday's post</a>, it looks like Saturday, August 6, is a better day for a Lernanta code-in than July 23.  Four people have said they're interested in learning about GitHub, Django, jQuery, and Lernanta itself---if you're in Toronto, and would like to join us, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">give me a shout</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/p2pu/Toronto-CA/149821/">sign up at Meetup.com</a>.

And if you're an intermediate-to-expert Javascript programmer, and would be willing to do some teaching that day to another group of people for a very good cause, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a> as well.
