title: And Speaking of Titus Brown...
---
<p>Michigan State's Titus Brown recently ran his course on analyzing next-generation sequencing data for the second time.  Judging from <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-11/ngs-2011.html">his report</a>, it was just as successful as last year's.  Congrats!</p>
