Alan Blackwell's course at Cambridge on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/R201/">usability of programming languages</a> has as its text a selection of chapters from a 1990 book on the psychology programming.  There's a ton of great material here: I'd love to see a revival of interest in the topic.
