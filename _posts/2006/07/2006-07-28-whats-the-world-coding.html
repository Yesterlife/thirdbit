I have no idea, but <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/images/ror/sf-treemap.png">this map</a> (created by <a href="http://qnot.org/">Andy Bruno</a>, and quoted by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/07/treemap_on_rails.html">Tim O'Reilly</a>) shows what people who use <a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a> are up to.

Update: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/rapidlanguagestrend.html">this image</a> shows book sales by language.  Having passed Python several months ago, Ruby has now also passed Perl. Maybe it really <em>is</em> time to convert the <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> course...

Another update: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/plangtrend2.html">here</a>'s a long-term version of the books-by-language graph.
