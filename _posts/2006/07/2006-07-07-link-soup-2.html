There are days when I believe my blog should consist of a simple redirect to Mike Gunderloy's <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Larkware</a>:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://buildix.thoughtworks.com/">Buildix</a> is a development platform on a disk: version control, bug tracking, continuous integration, and more, all on top of a single-disk <a href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a>. This is the second thing I've seen built on top of Knoppix; the first was <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html">Quantian</a>, which is a scientific development platform on a single disk.</li>
	<li>This <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/multiformats.asp">proposal</a> for using multi-part filenames like TimeSheet.txt.sgml.xml.snapper to identify content. Amazing the lengths people will jump through <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=247&page=1">to avoid metadata</a>... And it makes me wonder whether Monad---sorry, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">PowerShell</a>---is going to be the open window through which metadata sneaks into the house...</li>
	<li>Bill Gates is making it harder and harder for open source fanatics to sneer at him. Microsoft's latest is <a href="http://www.developwithoutborders.com/">Develop Without Borders</a>: write an Office 2007 application, and win money for the charity of your choice.</li>
</ul>
