The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ptp/index.php">Parallel Tools Platform</a> is an open source extension to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> for writing, running, and debugging large parallel programs.  This <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.ptp/doc/tutorials/PTP-workshop.pdf?cvsroot=Technology_Project">tutorial</a> gives an overview of what it can do (with lots of pretty pictures); this <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cise/menuitem.92a12adebee18778161489108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=cise_level1_article&TheCat=1001&path=cise/2006/v8n4&file=sci.xml&">article</a> from <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cise">CiSE</a> goes into more detail.  The lack of decent development tools (particularly debuggers) was one of the reasons I left parallel computing a decade ago; PTP almost looks nice enough to tempt me back into the pool...
