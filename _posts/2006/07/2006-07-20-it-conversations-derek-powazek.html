Derek Powazek's <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/reading.html#powazek-design-community"><em>Design for Community</em></a> was a very thought-provoking book; many of the ideas in <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> had their origins in it (the rest came from Jon Udell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565925378"><em>Practical Internet Groupware</em></a>, and from <a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a>).  There's now a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1089.html">recording</a> of a presentation he gave in March on the web; it's a little Web 2.0-ish, but well worth listening to, particularly as we're thinking about adding tag clouds and human-generated blogs to <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a>.
