1) <a href="http://www.quintura.com/">Quintura</a> is a search engine that uses tag clouds as an interface.  Very cool, and suggests a whole family of other tools...

2) <a href="http://timesnapper.com/">TimeSnapper</a> captures your desktop every few seconds all week long; you can then replay the sequence as a movie to find out what you were <em>actually</em> doing.
