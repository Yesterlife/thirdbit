<p>Brian Hayes' column in <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a> is almost always my favorite part of the magazine.  He now has a blog at <a href="http://bit-player.org/">http://bit-player.org/</a>, which I recommend highly.  I don't know anyone else who writes popular computer science this well, at this level---if you do, I'd be grateful for a pointer.</p>
