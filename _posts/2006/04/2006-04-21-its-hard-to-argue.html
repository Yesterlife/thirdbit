<p>...that Python's fragmented response to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> doesn't matter, or is even somehow a good thing, when you see <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/Q106plangtreemap.html">these</a> statistics: Python books sales this quarter are up 43% compared to last year, while Ruby's have grown a whopping seven times.  I don't know what the absolute numbers are---publishers and bookstores don't share that data---but I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000/">Python 3000</a> is going to have any impact on the shapes of these curves.</p>
