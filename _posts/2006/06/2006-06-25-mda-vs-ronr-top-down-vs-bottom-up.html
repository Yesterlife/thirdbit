title: "MDA vs. RonR: top-down vs. bottom-up?"

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture">Model-driven architecture</a>, or MDA, is the latest darling of those who would have us program by describing our system at a high level in something other than code, then generate something runnable automatically.  <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller">MVC</a> web application development framework that favors convention over configuration: for example, it maps your objects to database tables in a particular way, so that you don't have to worry about it, and can't mess it up.

My question is, are these really top-down vs. bottom-up approaches to the same geeky Nirvana? I have only played around with RonR so far, but at times, it really does feel like I'm modeling, rather than programming.  Once I know what my objects are, and how they relate to one another, much of what happens next happens automagically.  Yes, I still have to fill in details like the maximum size of a file upload by hand, but I'd have to do that with MDA, too.  Call me meatloaf, but it seems to me that if you slapped some WYSIWYG modeling tools on top of RonR, you could stick an MDA badge on the combination...
