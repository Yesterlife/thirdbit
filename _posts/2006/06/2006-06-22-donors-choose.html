Back in the day, there were bumper stickers saying, "It'll be a great day when education gets all the money it wants and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy bombers."  Well, the web might move us a little closer to that. <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/locale0/index.php">DonorsChoose</a> matches teachers who need resources, experience opportunities, and other support with public-spirited individuals willing to make micro-donations.  How long until something like this allows taxpayers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothecation">hypothecate</a> their contributions to their nation's finances?
