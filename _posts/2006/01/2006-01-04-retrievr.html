There's a persistent rumor that Google is about to unveil a music search tool: you hum or whistle a few bars, and it finds the tune for you.  Funny, right?  Until you try <a href="http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr/">Retrievr</a>.  Sketch this:

<img alt="retrievr01.png" id="image512" src="{{site.github.url}}/files/2006/06/retrievr01.png" />
and it pulls up "matching" pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.  The first hit I got was:

<img alt="retrievr02.png" id="image513" src="{{site.github.url}}/files/2006/06/retrievr02.png" />
Not bad...  Not bad at all...
