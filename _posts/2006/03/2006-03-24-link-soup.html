<p>These links accumulated while I was in Peru:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.12">Why I Hate Frameworks</a>, from the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a> discussion group.  Funny, but am I the only one who found the casual reference to killing ex-girlfriends with hammers disturbing?  The proportion of women going into most CS programs is still declining, and as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262632691">Margolis and Fisher</a> showed, violent and misogynist language is part of the reason.  This is why I no longer review books based on "programming as war" metaphors, like Faroult and Robson's new <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/artofsql/">The Art of SQL</a>.  (Coincidentally, I read Danc's piece on <a href="http://lostgarden.com/2006/03/root-of-shock-game-advertising.html">shock game advertising</a> just a few minutes after the Spolsky piece...)</li>

<li>This roundup of <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001163.php">consensus web filters</a> opens with a clear description of what these Web 2.0 tools are trying to do, and how best to use them.  Kevin Kelly's site also showcases <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001164.php">Cuboro</a>, which he claims is the best toy since Lego.</li>

<li>Chris Bliss <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4776181634656145640">juggles</a> to the music of The Beatles.  Of course, calling what he does "juggling" is like looking at a Picasso and saying, "Ah, paint."</li>

<li>A <a href="http://insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=mar06&amp;msg=10">long and thoughtful post</a> from Michelle Levesque about Google's decision to censor content in China.  Michelle's about to go work for Google; I feel a little better about <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/40076">their future plans</a> knowing she's going to be there.  "We'd rather have the bad guys running everything // Than have nobody running things at all."</li>

<li>This <a href="http://loom.corante.com/archives/2006/03/11/a_retraction_and_a_deletion.php">retraction and deletion</a>, from science journalist Carl Zimmer, is a perfect example of responsible blogging.  As he says, deleting posts you have discovered to be in error isn't a perfect solution, but it's the best available for now.</li>

<li><a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/03/confessions_of_.html">Confessions of a Virtual Intelligence Analyst</a> (plus the outbound links) is a fascinating look at on-line surveillance in gaming worlds.  "Guild churn", anyone?</li>

<li>Eric Sink predicts <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Magazines_Dying.html">the demise of developer-oriented magazines</a>.  Sadly, I agree; guess I should start looking for another (for-pay) outlet for book reviews...  On the other hand, if <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/3/21/1833521.html">Lee Falin's article</a> is right, maybe there won't be any in a couple of years.</li>

<li>A screencast of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore">Spore</a>, which might turn out to be the Best Game Ever [tm].</li>

<li>And finally, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html">Math for Programmers</a>, from Steve Yegge (via <a href="http://blog.cfrq.net/chk/">Harald Koch</a>).  There are some interesting ideas here for educators (and everyone else, too).</li>

</ul>
