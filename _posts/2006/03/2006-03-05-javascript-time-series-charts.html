We'd like to add some simple time-series charts to <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a>.  We've played with <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a> (server-side Python, a pain to install) and <a href="http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/">XML/SWF Flash charts</a> (can't handle irregularly-spaced data, not open source, requires Flash); and I'm wondering: are there any libraries out there to do this in Javascript?  Our needs are very, very simple...  Pointers to <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">me</a>, please.
