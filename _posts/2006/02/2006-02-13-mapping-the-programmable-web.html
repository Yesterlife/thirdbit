<p>I've seen the phrase "post-modern programming" used a lot in the past few
months to describe the notion of improvising web interfaces to useful
applications (like Flickr or Google Maps), and then gluing them together
to create something new.  <a href="http://programmableweb.com/matrix">This table</a> shows a cross-product of ideas, so that you can see who's gluing MSN
Messenger and eBay together, or NASA and Flickr.  Very cool.</p>
