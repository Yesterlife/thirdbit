<a href="http://www.insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=oct06&msg=05">Google</a> has launched <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/05/google-presents-code-search/">Code Search</a>, which does exactly what the name says.  <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=%22you+are+not+expected+to+understand%22&btnG=Search">You are not expected to understand</a> <a href="http://www.crazyaboutgadgets.com/related.asp?product_extra=USB%20Hamster%20Wheel">this</a>.

<em>Later</em>: you can find <em>lots</em> of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search">cool things</a> with Code Search...

Later still: another <a href="http://blog.predius.org/2006/10/05/fucks-per-source-package-and-license/">reason to like Python</a>... ;-)
