<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/10/im_going_to_become_a_fonero.html">Fonero</a> is a WiFi-sharing service with an interesting business model.  I've 'borrowed' unencrypted wireless from time to time in strange places, though I no longer run a wide-open on my modem at home (I need all the bandwidth for work ;-).  It'll be interesting to see if this takes off...
