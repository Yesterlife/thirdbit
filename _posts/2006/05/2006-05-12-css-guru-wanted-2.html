<p>Now that my new laptop and monitor are working [<a href="#1">1</a>], I hope to wrap up Version 2 of the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> notes and close the file.  However, the last step is one I can't take myself: I need 4-5 hours of help from someone who knows their way around CSS, and can rewrite my rather crufty style files to make the notes beautiful.  If you're interested in contributing to this particular open source project, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">contact me</a>.</p>
