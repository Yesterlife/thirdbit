<p><a href="http://osl.iu.edu/~tveldhui/">Todd Veldhuizen</a> (who is, as I have observed <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000282.html">before</a>, simultaneously one of the smartest nice guys, and nicest smart guys, I know) has just accepted a position at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>.  It'll be great to have him back in Canada.</p>
