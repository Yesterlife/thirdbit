Scott Meyers has an interesting <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_publications.html">article</a> up about the five most important non-book publications in the history of C++.  They're all still interesting reading --- I was tickled to see that <a href="http://www.ece.uwaterloo.ca/People/faculty/veldhuizen.html">Todd Veldhuizen</a>'s article on template metaprogramming made the list --- and remind me (yet again) what a good job the C++ community has done of documenting how the language got to where it is.  (Every serious programmer should read Stroustrup's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201543303"><em>Design and Evolution of C++</em></a> at least once.)
