The 2007 edition of the <a href="http://www.cusec.net/">Canadian Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference</a> will be held in Montreal on January 18-20.  Their <a href="http://www.cusec.net/2007">blog</a> is live, and they already have some good speakers lined up.  If you're a student looking to make connections, this would be a good place to start.
