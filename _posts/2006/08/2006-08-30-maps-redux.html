The <a href="http://www.third-bit.com">third-bit.com home page</a> now displays an up-to-date map showing where everyone who's ever taken part in one our projects was born.  I'm a little unsure about the placement of some of the dots (especially in Ukraine and China); corrections would be welcome.

As you can probably tell, I went with <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> in the end. This wasn't because <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com">Yahoo Maps</a> or any of the other sites I wrestled with couldn't do what I wanted; instead, it came down to which was better documented.  Let that be a lesson to students, and to those who think it's code that matters most... ;-)
