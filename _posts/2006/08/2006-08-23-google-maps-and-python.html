I've been rationalizing my database of CSC49X project participants, and want to update the map that appears on this site's <a href="http://www.third-bit.com">home page</a>.  I'm going to have to do this every three or four months, so I'd like a simple Python script that takes a bunch of latitudes and longitudes, and gives me back a map with those locations mapped (bonus marks if I can also specify the colors of the markers, to differentiate people by year or role).  I know Google Maps and other services will let me do this, but I don't have a couple of hours to spend trawling through the results of a search for "google maps python" or the like.  If you have something that'll solve my problem, I'd be grateful for a ping.

And this gives me an excuse to make <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/614.html">yet another suggestion</a> to the good folks at Google. I can already use "define: patacriticism" to search for word definitions.  How come I can't use "python: map API" to search for the words "map" and "API" in the documentation for Python code?  I'm told by reliable sources that it would be easy to implement; it'd be a very useful thing to have on the intranet search box of any software development shop, and most importantly, it'd give open source developers an incentive to start documenting their code a little better.  Right now, the payoff for doing so is fuzzy and remote; if people could google APIs that exactly, well, I don't think it could hurt...
