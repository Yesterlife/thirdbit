A screencast for the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/olm-screencast.html">online marking tool</a> (built using <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> and AJAX) is now up.  It's a very cool tool --- I'm really looking forward to seeing how students and TAs react.  I've also relocated the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/drproject-screencast.html">DrProject screencast</a> to the department's server in order to reduce the load on ours. We're just days away from the 1.1 release, with performance enhancements, web-based administration, tag clouds, and more --- stay tuned.
