We did post-mortems for the summer projects last week and the week before, and I'm reading Derby and Larsen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616649"><em>Agile Retrospectives</em></a>, so <a href="http://www.lightworksgames.com/blog/entry.aspx?entryid=ebad63ce-a1b5-4043-84e0-a23d50d9163f">this piece</a> was quite timely --- I'll use it as an example in class.  (Via <a href="http://www.larkware.com">Mike Gunderloy</a>, again.)
