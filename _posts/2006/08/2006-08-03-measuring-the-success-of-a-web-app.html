Mike McDerment has <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/how-to-measure-the-success-of-your-web-app">posted</a> an updated version of the presentation he gave at <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto8">DemoCamp 8</a>. It's a good intro to the topics that O'Reilly's Web <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000323.html"><em>Site Measurement Hacks</em></a> covers in more detail; wish we could find a place to fit this into the curriculum.
