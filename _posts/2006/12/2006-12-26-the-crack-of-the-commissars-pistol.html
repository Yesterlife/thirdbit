I don't know <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/">Peter Guttmann</a>, but judging from his <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.txt">cost analysis Windows Vista content protection</a> (note: <em>not</em> cost-benefit analysis, since there aren't enough of the latter to count), he'd be an interesting drinking companion.  (Via <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/a_cost_analysis.html">Bruce Schneier</a>.)  It's hard to square this with <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/08.html">Jon Udell's belief in a new, more open Microsoft</a>...
