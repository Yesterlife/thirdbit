<a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com">Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</a>'s latest column in <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/software/"><em>IEEE Software</em></a> is titled  "Explaining Your Design".  She posits a hierarchy of importance in  explanation:
<ul>
	<li>things you can't change</li>
	<li>problem description and requirements</li>
	<li>things (entities)</li>
	<li>organizing structures</li>
	<li>the typical case</li>
	<li>concrete examples</li>
	<li>design principles</li>
</ul>
She also talks about the importance of story lines in explanations. It's   thought-provoking, particularly as we're trying to think of requirements management and documentation components for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.
