title: "OER Landmines"
---

Some great discussions this past week with some new friends in the Open Educational Resources movement.
A few things that came out of it:

1.  Nobody should ever build another lesson repository ever again, because they don't work.
    Instead, people should focus on making lessons findable (proper tagging for search engines).

2.  Anyone starting an OER project of any kind needs to plan right from day one for handover
    from early adopters (who are keen on the idea of OER)
    to early majority (who just want to teach).

3.  "GitHub for teachers" is a dead end because version control is too high a cover charge for most teachers and learners.
    (See the previous point: early adopters will use it because it's cool, everyone else will vote "no" with their feet.)
    "Wikipedia for teachers" is a dead end because its model of one definitive narrative on any subject isn't the right one.

4.  The [Reusability Paradox](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3854) states that,
    "The pedagogical effectiveness of a learning object and its potential for reuse are completely at odds with one another".
    Options for dealing with it are:
    1.  Fine-grained decontextualized resources that are highly reusable but teach very little and require a lot of work to assemble.
    2.  Highly contextualized resources that are pedagogically effective but hard to re-use.
    3.  The mediocre middle.
    4.  Reducing barriers such as licensing that inhibit remixing (which is not the same as unmodified re-use).

I've got a lot to think about.
In particular,
"Stack Overflow for teachers" doesn't seem to have been tried yet at scale,
and once again I'm back to Caulfield's [choral explanations](https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/).
