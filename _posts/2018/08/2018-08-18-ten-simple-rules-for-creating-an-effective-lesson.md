title: Ten Simple Rules for Creating an Effective Lesson
---

I'm preparing a couple of talks based on *[Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech)*,
and this seems like a useful topic to cover.
Preliminary notes are below;
I'd be grateful for [feedback by email](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).
(I've disabled comments on this site until the trolls find someone else to pester.)

1.  Use Learner Personas to Define Your Audience
    -   A lesson is a user interface for knowledge, so borrow methods from user interface design
    -   General background
    -   What they already know
    -   What they think they want to know
    -   Special considerations (e.g., accessibility, child care)
    -   How the lesson will help them achieve their aims
    -   First four parts are usually shared across multiple lessons and instructors
2.  Write Summative Assessments to Set Concrete Goals
    -   "Understand linear regression" is vague; a specific exercise makes aim much clearer
    -   Also helps communicate value of lesson to learners
3.  Write Formative Assessments for Pacing, Design, Preparation, and Reinforcement
    -   Spend 1-2 minutes checking in with learners via formative assessment every 10-15 minutes
    -   Pacing: are they still with you?
    -   Design: they act as milestones building toward the summative assessment
    -   Preparation: everything in the summative assessment should be exercised by a formative assessment
    -   Reinforcement: learners remember more if they use material right away
    -   (Almost always tell you that you're trying to cover too much)
4.  Make Prerequisites Explicit
    -   Enumerating prerequisite knowledge and skills helps you overcome expert blind spot
    -   And helps stitch lessons together
    -   Danger of intimidating learners who have impostor syndrome
    -   As with summative assessment, works best when concrete: not "understand linear regression", but "can do the following"
5.  Foster Collaboration Among Learners
    -   Peer instruction is the most effective scalable teaching practice known
    -   So build lesson around discursive formative assessments
    -   *The Discussion Book* has many other methods (e.g., think-pair-share)
8.  Use PETE: Problem, Explanation, Theory, Example
    -   The twelve-bar blues of STEM
    -   What is the authentic problem that the lesson solves next?
    -   Explain a concrete solution
    -   Fill in the underlying theory
    -   Provide a second example so that learners will understand which parts generalize
    -   Authentic problem may be an end goal, or in later lessons, may arise out of a previous solution
6.  Introduce One Thing at a Time
    -   Cognitive load: learners are trying to recall factual knowledge, choose a solution strategy, formulate a response, use tools, etc.
    -   Teach those separately and then synthesize as a lesson in its own right
    -   Naming subgoals helps
7.  Value Clarity over Detail
    -   Build a usable mental model so that learners have somewhere to put knowledge, then correct the model as necessary
    -   E.g., ball-and-spring model in chemistry, evolution solely by descent, CPU-memory-disk model in computing
    -   Concept mapping is a good way to externalize cognition during design and for feedback
9.  Show How to Detect, Diagnose, and Correct Common Mistakes
    -   Novices spend much of their time making mistakes and trying to fix them, because they're novices
    -   Including DD&C in the lesson reduces frustration, which in turn accelerates learning
    -   Also helps solidify their mental model
10. Foster Collaboration with Other Instructors
    -   FAIR Principles for data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) also apply to lessons, but "reusable" is weak
    -   Instead of one author broadcasting for others to use, foster collaboration in a teaching commons
    -   Open source software and Wikipedia demonstrate the benefits
    -   Increases inclusivity and reduces lesson maintenance burden
    -   And it's more fun
