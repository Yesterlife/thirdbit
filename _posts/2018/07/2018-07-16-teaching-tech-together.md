I am very pleased to announce the publication of *[Teaching Tech
Together]({{page.website}})*, a much-expanded successor to *How to
Teach Programming (and Other Things)*.  As the book's blurb says:

> Hundreds of grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to
> teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills outside
> traditional classrooms.  These groups exist so that people don't
> have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their
> founders and instructors are often teaching themselves how to teach.
>
> There's a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs
> and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about
> psychology, lesson design, inclusivity, and community organization
> can help you be a more effective teacher. This book presents
> evidence-based practices you can use right now, explains why we
> believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will
> help you go further.

Parts of the book were originally created for Software Carpentry's
[instructor training
program](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), which has
been run over a hundred times during the past six years.  You can
