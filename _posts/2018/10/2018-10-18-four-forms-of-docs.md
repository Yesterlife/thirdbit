title: "Four Forms of Documentation"
---

A colleague recently pointed me at [this article by Daniele Procida](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)
that divides software documentation into four categories:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Most useful when studying</th>
    <th>Most useful when working</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Practical steps</th>
    <td>Tutorial<br/>(learning-oriented)</td>
    <td>How-to Guide<br/>(problem-oriented)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Theoretical knowledge</th>
    <td>Explanation<br/>(understanding-oriented)</td>
    <td>Reference<br/>(information-oriented)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

It's a useful taxonomy,
and I've been trying to map it onto the [novice-competent-expert model](http://teachtogether.tech/en/models/).
What I have so far is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Trying to acquire/deepen knowledge</th>
    <th>Trying to accomplish specific task</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tentative mental model<br/>(novice)</th>
    <td>Tutorial</td>
    <td>How-to Guide</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Working mental model<br/>(competent practitioner)</th>
    <td>Explanation</td>
    <td>Reference</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I'm still not satisfied with this:
how-to guides are also useful for competent practitioners who
(for example)
have temporarily forgotten how much salt to put in the soda bread.
On the other hand,
I think Procida's identification of tutorials with practical knowledge
and explanations with theoretical knowledge is less useful
than identifying the two audiences and the state of their mental models.
I'd be very grateful for pointers to other ways of classifying different types of documentation
and their theoretical underpinnings.
