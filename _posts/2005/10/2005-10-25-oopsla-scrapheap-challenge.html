<p>I didn't go to <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005">OOPSLA</a> this year (OK, I've <em>never</em> gone to <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005">OOPSLA</a>, despite meaning to several times), but from what I'm reading, one of the most entertaining events was the <a href="http://www.xpdeveloper.com/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ScrapheapChallenge">Scrapheap Challenge</a>, in which participants were given a problem to solve by downloading  freely-available code from the Internet and gluing it together.  Some people have started referring to this as "post-modern programming" (PM because no one creates anything new any more, we just remix what's already been done).  I wonder what kind of third-year programming assignment it would make?  Or, a better question, I wonder what kind of course we could teach for which this would be a natural programming assignment?</p>
