<p>For the past few weeks, <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~heathermayer">Heather Mayer</a> has been turning my scratchings into some really rather beautiful drawings for the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> course.  If you'd like to see more of her work, Pyre is now hosting <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~heathermayer">her site</a>.  And if you're looking for a graphic designer, I'd recommend her highly.</p>
