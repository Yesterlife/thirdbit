<p>This week's episode of House (the only new show this season I bother watching) chronicled the good doctor's attempt to go a week without using painkillers for his leg.  I sympathize---thanks to some drywall dust and a burned-out power supply, I was unable to access my personal mail for almost sixty hours.  It's all good now, though; it's aaaaallll gooooood.....</p>

<p>So, here are a few links that have accumulated in the meantime:</p>

<ul>

<li>Bruce Schneier on <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/unicode_url_hac_1.html">Unicode security holes</a>.</li>

<li>Schneier again on a new tool called <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/ghostbuster.html">GhostBuster</a> that uses a zero-information strategy to find viruses, trojans, etc.</li>

<li>A <a href="http://www.gamermom.blogspot.com/">mother and son blog about computer games</a>, which ties back to <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~alf/">Allan Fisher</a>'s excellent talk on gender in computer science education.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000474.html">Another rant</a> (this by James Governor) about how SOAP is the "new CORBA", i.e., is so bloated and clumsy that developers are using just about anything else instead.</li>

<li>This <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/384122">clever hack</a> allows you to create new infix operators in Python.  I'd beat any student who ever did it in production code, but it's a very clever idea.</li>

<li>Also for Python fans, here's an article about <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/02/agile-documentation-with-doctest-and.html">agile documentation</a>, which is a fancy phrase for "let the tests explain what the code does".  I may have to reconsider my dislike of this...</li>

<li>For Windows users, a nice file system management tool called <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a>.</li>

<li>java.net's <a href="http://community.java.net/edu-gelc/">Global Education and Learning Community</a>, which has lots of interesting links.  (Can I offshore my web surfing?)</li>

<li>A magazine called <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/BetterSoftware/magazine.asp">Better Software</a>.  I've only read one issue (found it by accident), but I was very impressed.</li>

<li>And the Vatican is finally offering a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/02/17/satanism-vatican0217.html?ref=rss">course on Satanism</a>.  'Bout time they updated their brand's image...</li>

</ul>
