Tuesday, 15 February 2005, 11:10AM -- Bahen Centre, Room 1180
Department of Computer Science
Speaker: Professor Allan Fisher, President and CEO of iCarnegie Inc.
Title: "Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing"
</pre>

<p>For those who don't know their work, Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher set up a program at CMU to attract more female students to CS, and (just as importantly) to retain them.  Their work is described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262632691">their book</a>; I'm really looking forward to Allan's talk.</p>
