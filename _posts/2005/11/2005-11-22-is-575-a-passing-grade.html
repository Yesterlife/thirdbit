<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> has posted the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html">reading list</a> for his Software Management Training Program.  Only four of the books are in the geek books portion of my <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/reading.html">reading list</a> (which, BTW, will soon include Doar's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007965">Practical Development Enviornments</a> and Fogel's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007590">Producing Open Source Software</a>).  One of the reasons my score is so low is that most of Spolsky's list is business books, or computer company war stories --- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887308554">Accidental Empires</a> is there, but surprisingly, neither <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670812781">West of Eden</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812930061">The Plot to Get Bill Gates</a> made it.  And what is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590591046">In Search of Stupidity</a> doing on anyone's "best of" list?</p>
