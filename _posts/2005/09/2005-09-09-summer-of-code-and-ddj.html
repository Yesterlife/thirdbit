I'm collecting articles from participants in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> for <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb's Journal</a>.  We're going to run 4-8 articles, each roughly 400 words long, for several months.  It's pretty cool stuff---I'm awed by the talent of the students who took part.
