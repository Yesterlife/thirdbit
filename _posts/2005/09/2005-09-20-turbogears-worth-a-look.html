On Saturday, <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">Turbogears</a>, a new python web "mega" framework was released.  I was very impressed, because:

* It builds on tools that I think are the most promising: SQLObject, CherryPy
* It shows you exactly how to connect these tools with a templating system, Kid, to provide a complete solution like Ruby on Rails does.
* It includes and facilitates the use of MochiKit to do easy AJAX.
* Best of all, the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/docs/wiki20/20MinuteWiki.mov">screencast</a> proved to me that it was dead easy!
