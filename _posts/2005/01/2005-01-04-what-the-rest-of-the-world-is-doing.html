<p><a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/index.php?p=64">This blog posting</a>, from <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a>'s David Ascher, describes an art exhibit in Vancouver called <a href="http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/exhibitions_massive.cfm">Massive Change</a>.  It looks fascinating; I hope to catch it when it <a href="http://www.toronto.com/profile/876578/">comes to Toronto</a>.</p>
