<p><a href="http://www.larkware.com">Mike Gunderloy</a>'s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X">Coder to Developer</a> was one of my top 10 for 2004 (and the sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214361X">Developer to Designer</a>, looks every bit as good).  He has just posted an article on <a href="http://developer.com/design/article.php/3460041">"User Choice, Customization, and Confusion"</a> that says a lot of sensible things.</p>
