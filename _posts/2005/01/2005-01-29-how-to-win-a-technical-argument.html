<p>I laughed when I read <a href="http://www.skirsch.com/humor/techarg.htm">this</a>, especially when I realized that I used #11, #22, #33, #34, #48, #55, <em>and</em> #70 in a single email message to my students...</p>

<p>Then I realized that I've lost count of how many times people have said #43 to me...</p>
