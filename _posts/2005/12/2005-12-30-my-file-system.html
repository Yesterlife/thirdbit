Here's a <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~gvwilson/myfilesys.png">tree view of my computer's file system</a>, courtesy of <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/">SequoiaView</a>.  The big yellow block is M4A music files; the big green one is MP3's, the gray rectangle in the upper right hand corner is <code>pagefile.sys</code>, and the gold-gray-and-blue fishscales in the middle near the bottom are the Windows system DLLs.  Pretty.
