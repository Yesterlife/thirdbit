<p>Once again, I have to quote William Gibson: the future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed.  Check out <a href="http://www.eyeos.org">eyeOS</a>, a desktop-in-a-browser that comes with editor, calculator, and a bunch of other tools.  Sure, it's kind of slow, but it's very pretty...  You can even take it for a <a href="http://www.eyeos.org/?section=Test">test drive</a>.</p>
