<p>A <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon.skeet/archive/2005/12/22/79631.aspx">nice list</a> of some things that Eclipse does better than Visual Studio (which is still my favorite IDE).  I got it from Mike Gunderloy's always-excellent <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Larkware</a> blog; if anyone sees a follow-up post describing things that VS does better than Eclipse, please let me know.</p>

<p>(And note in passing how few of these things are debugging aids---looks like there's lots of room to turn the ideas in <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000335.html">Andreas Zeller's book</a> into plugins, if anyone wants to make a name for themselves.)</p>
