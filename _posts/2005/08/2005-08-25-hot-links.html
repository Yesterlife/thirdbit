<p>Karen Reid's having so much fun writing a little Python CGI to do some on-line data entry that I decided to take some time off from editing the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> course notes, and get my <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/hotlinks.html">bookmarks</a> on-line.  Enjoy...</p>
