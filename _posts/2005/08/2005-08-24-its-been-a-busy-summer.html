Over the past four months, our five undergraduate students have done a ton of work on our fork of <a href="http://projects.edgwall.com/trac">Trac</a> (which we're now calling DrProject).  They've designed a new interface, written a ton of code, refactored another ton, and fixed and filed a anthill's worth of bugs.  I think they've learned a few things too---Karen Reid and I certainly have.  So, um, thanks, kids---it's been a great summer.
