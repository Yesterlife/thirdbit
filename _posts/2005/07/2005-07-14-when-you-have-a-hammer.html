<p>...it makes sense to go looking for nails.  When you have a new way to organize information that works well in one context, it makes sense to see how well it will solve problems in others.  <a href="http://blueslugs.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2005/07/12/tag1-delicious-style-file-tagging/">This</a> is a working sketch (in Perl) of how we might use <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>-style tags to organize a filesystem.
