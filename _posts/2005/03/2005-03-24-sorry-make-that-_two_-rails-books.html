<p>As Dave <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/RailsRecipes.rdoc">says</a>, the cat's out of the bag: there's a Rails Recipes book in the works.  Really, really hope this year's PyCon produces a concerted effort to create (or choose, I'm not fussy) a Pythonic equivalent.</p>
