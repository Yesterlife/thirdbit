<p>I've decided what I want for (quick check) Saint Zosimus' Day: a Windows-compatible screensaver that will:</p>

<ul>
<li>poll a web site for an XML file containing a to-do list; and</li>
<li>display that list whenever my computer goes idle for 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus marks if it'll run on Linux and Mac; more bonus marks if it comes with a command-line tool, a Firefox browser plugin, an HTML form interface, <em>and</em> a little standalone GUI for editing to-do entries.  Note that running a browser in full-screen mode as a "background" doesn't count.</p>
