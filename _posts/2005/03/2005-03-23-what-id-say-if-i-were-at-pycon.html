<p>Dave Thomas, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X">Pragmatic Programmer</a> fame, is working on a <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/RailsDHH.rdoc">new book</a> about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">RubyOnRails</a>.  In my opinion, none of the entry-level Python web programming systems that Michelle Levesque has been <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/pyweb/index.html">studying</a> is book-worthy yet, despite being several years older than RonR. It's things like this that are going to make Ruby the refuge of choice for refugees from Perl 6. *sigh*</p>
