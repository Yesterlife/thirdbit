<p>Sam Ruby has posted a <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/">slide set</a> from a recent talk on open source.  It includes this:</p>

<blockquote>
Larry's Psychological Conjecture:
<br />
For normal people, the perceived usefulness of a computer language is inversely proportional to the amount of theory the language forces you to learn.
</blockquote>

<p>Is this why Perl, Python, and Ruby have succeeded where Scheme, Haskell, and ML did not?</p>
