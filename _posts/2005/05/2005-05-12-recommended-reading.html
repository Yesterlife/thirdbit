I have updated my <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/reading.html">recommended reading list</a>; it now includes descriptions (many of them culled from my reviews for <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb's Journal</a>), and cover images that link directly to <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.  Enjoy...

Later: I've added five more books to the recommended reading list:
<ul>
	<li>Feathers: Working Effectively with Legacy Code</li>
	<li>Levine: Linkers and Loaders</li>
	<li>Margolis and Fisher: Unlocking the Clubhouse</li>
	<li>Skoudis: Malware</li>
	<li>Spinellis: Code Reading</li>
</ul>
May 15: I've added some fiction and general non-fiction entries.
