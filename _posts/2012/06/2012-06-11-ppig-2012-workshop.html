Deadlines

Full Papers 10th July

Doctorial Consortium 31st July

The Psychology of Programming Group (PPIG) invites abstracts for the 2012 meeting, to be held at Newcastle University, UK.

PPIG wants papers on the psychological aspects of every area of software development: education, language design, software engineering, programmer team working etc. Papers can adopt a strictly theoretical approach, be entirely empirical, or feature a mix of both&mdash;whatever is appropriate. The list of possible themes has grown over the years and currently looks like this :
<ul>
	<li>Empirical studies of programming</li>
	<li>Programming education and skills acquisition</li>
	<li>Human centred design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure</li>
	<li>Programming and human cognition</li>
	<li>Human Computer Interaction issues in programming</li>
	<li>Team/co-operative work in programming</li>
	<li>End user programming</li>
	<li>Distributed programming, globalisation, work in large teams</li>
	<li>Free/libre open source software development</li>
	<li>Software engineering methods, planning, estimation, agility etc.</li>
	<li>Gender, age, culture and programming</li>
	<li>New paradigms in programming</li>
	<li>Code quality, readability and re-use</li>
	<li>Mistakes, bugs, and error handling</li>
	<li>Working with notation</li>
	<li>Specialist and domain centred programming tools and languages</li>
	<li>Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming</li>
</ul>
However, we are open to any new ideas and topics.

SUBMISSION

Full papers should be 12 pages or less; Short Papers and Work in Progress reports are also welcome. To format your paper, please use the PPIG Word Template or the LaTeX template, which will be available from the website which will be online shortly. The programme committee will review all submitted papers and, based on their reviews, each accepted paper will be classified as a "Full Technical Paper" or a "Work in Progress Report". All papers accepted for presentation at PPIG 2012 will appear in the workshop proceedings and be archived on the PPIG website.

Authors may also submit a Short Paper or a Work in Progress Report, clearly marked as such, to describe conjectural, late-breaking or tentative results. The refereeing process will be suitably lighter. Papers for the workshop should be submitted to Lindsay.marshall@ncl.ac.uk with a subject line reading "PPIG2012 Paper Submission: [Title of Paper]" and have a PDF version of the paper paper as an attachment.

Doctoral Consortium

The PPIG Workshop will again hold a doctoral consortium. The event is for research students at all stages of doctoral study. The event will include brief introductions by each of the students (about 10 minutes, plus time for questions, depending on the numbers involved) and sessions on the process and practice of Ph.D. research. Experienced researcher will take part as 'discussants' to give other perspectives and to provide feedback on individual research programs.

Submission: applications must provide an overview of your research (max 5 pages) and be submitied by email to M.Kutar@salford.ac.uk with the subject 'PPIG2011 doctoral consortium submission'. The submission should be in PDF format.

Dates

	<li>10 July: submission of draft papers</li>
	<li>10 August: authors will be notified</li>
