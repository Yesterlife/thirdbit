I'm trying to compile a list of grassroots "learn to program" organizations that are explicitly trying to broaden participation in computing beyond the current white-and-Asian male demographic. So far, I know of the ones listed below; if you know of others, I'd welcome pointers. (Note: while I think that the <a href="http://anitaborg.org/">Anita Borg Institute</a> and others are doing great work, I'm mostly interested in groups trying to build new on ramps, rather than groups supporting women who are already in tech.)
