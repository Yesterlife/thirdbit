I'm very pleased to announce that the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a> has generously agreed to fund six months of work by Software Carpentry and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>. You can <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/2012/01/sloan-foundation-grant-to-software-carpentry-and-mozilla/">read more</a> on the Software Carpentry blog; it's going to be a lot of work, but I'm looking forward to it.
