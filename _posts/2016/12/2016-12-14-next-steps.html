  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>
  has accomplished an amazing amount over the past six and a half years,
  but a new opportunity has come up for me here in Toronto that will let me spend more time with my family,
  and after a great deal of thought,
  I've decided to pursue it.
  At the end of January 2017,
  I will be taking a position as a Computer Science Education Lead at <a href="http://shopify.ca">Shopify</a>,
  where I will help with their <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/education">CS education partnerships</a>.
  I'm excited to have a chance to work for change locally,
  but also look forward to continuing to be involved in Software Carpentry as a volunteer,
  and to many more discussions of teaching, open science, and how awful Git truly is.

  It's been a privilege to get to know
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/team/">the hundreds of people</a>
  who have made Software Carpentry what it is today,
  and to help thousands of researchers worldwide do more in less time, and with less pain.
  We've come a long way since our first workshop in July 1998;
  I can't wait to see what the next eighteen years will bring.
