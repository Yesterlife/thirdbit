I presented "Research This! Questions that Computing Educators Most Want Computing Education Researchers to Answer"
at [ICER 2019](https://icer.acm.org/) this morning,
and the full paper is now available [on this site]({{site.github.url}}/files/2019/08/research-this.pdf)
and [through the ACM](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3339402).
It was a pleasure to work with Paul, Brett, Michelle, and Piotr,
and I hope people will find our results useful.
