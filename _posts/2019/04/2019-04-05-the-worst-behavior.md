title: "The Worst Behavior"

Yesterday,
DataCamp belatedly [acknowledged](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community)
an incident of sexual assault that took place at the company in 2017.
They euphemistically refer to it as "unwanted physical contact",
and the rest of their post is written in the same vein.
(Apparently the investigation was conducted by “a third party not involved in DataCamp’s day-to-day business”,
which begs the question what kind of involvement they *did* have...)
<https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1113939480300355584> has a de-euphemized version,
while <https://twitter.com/no_reply/status/1113923302915837958> and other threads offer analysis.

People say that the culture of an organization is defined by the worst behavior its leaders are willing to tolerate.
I think it's also defined by the worst behavior by the leaders that the rank and file are willing to tolerate.
DataCamp's statement only appeared after considerable pressure from the community,
and its half-heartedness and deflection just make me sad.

*Full disclosure: DataCamp fired me in June 2017 for "poor performance".*
