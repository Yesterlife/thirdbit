> **Summary**
>
> We propose a three-day workshop to give people in open science the practical skills needed
> to get their universities and companies to change for the better.

## Background

Many people in various open science communities have technical skills and good intentions,
but no experience engineering structural change in organizations.
Updating curriculum guidelines to make room for data science training,
nurturing a regional R user group that can sustain itself,
removing bias from hiring practices,
and convincing politicians and business leaders to base policy on the best available evidence
all require a set of skills that most scientists have never been taught.
Fortunately, we do not have to invent these skills ourselves:
many groups before us have managed to make the kinds of changes we now seek
and can teach us how to be more effective.

## Proposal

We propose a three-day workshop,
during which participants rotate through six half-day training sessions followed by half a day of open discussion and planning.
The topics listed below give an idea of the kinds of things we would include;
the final list would be put together in consultation with senior figures in the community,
and we would be grateful for suggestions and additions.

- Marketing for scientists (e.g., [Kuchner's book of the same name](https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Scientists-Shine-Tough-Times/dp/1597269948/))
  so that they learn how to match what they want with what people think they need.
- Strategies for institutional change (e.g., Manns & Rising's *[Fearless Change](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Change-Patterns-Introducing-paperback/dp/0134395255/)*)
  so that they will have a toolbox for acting on what they know.
- How to be an effective ally (e.g., [Aurora's workshop on ally skills](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/))
  so that they know how to use their power and influence to support people who are targets of discrimination.
- Improv (e.g., [Holmes' workshop on communicating science](http://improvscience.org/services))
  so that they will be better able to think on their feet.
- Personal digital security (e.g., [the Electronic Frontier Foundation's training materials](https://sec.eff.org/)),
  because online harassment is unfortunately now a fact of life,
  and people in visible roles need to safeguard themselves against it.
- Community organization (e.g., Brown's *[Building Powerful Community Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/)*),
  which lays out the steps needed to build an effective grassroots organization.

Participants would be selected based on:

1. Previously-demonstrated commitment to growing an inclusive open science community.
2. Career stage: we will give preference to people who are likely to be able to act on what they learn in the 1-2 years following the workshop.
3. Reach: we will give preference to people who live and work outside regions that are already hotbeds of open science.

## Benefits

Many people now share a vision of a better kind of science:
one that is open, inclusive, and listened to.
The more skills they have for effecting institutional change, the sooner that vision will be realized.

**Notes**

- The budget per instructor assumes $6,000 for 3 days of training plus $2,000 in expenses.
- We expect that most organizing will be done by volunteers, but have included 20 days of paid support staff time as well.
- Participants will be charged $300 (mostly to reduce no-shows) and will be required to cover their own travel and accommodation costs, as well as their own breakfasts and dinners.
- This budget assumes that a third of participants need some support in order to be able to attend.
  The actual figure may be higher, particularly if we wish to concentrate on helping people in underserved areas.
