title: "What I Would Write (If I Was Smarter Than I Am)"
---

Yesterday I wrote about
[things I would do if I still did research]({{site.github.url}}/2019/06/05/things-i-would-do.html),
but they're all less important than what I would write if I was smarter than I am.
Most of the young programmers I know have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As inequality widens,
as white nationalism comes roaring back on stage,
as we do everything in our power to make climate change *worse*,
and as companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in ever-more-contorted knots
to avoid taking responsibility for their actions,
most programmers don't have the intellectual tools needed
to understand what's gone wrong and how we might fix it.
Why do gender and racial discrimination persist despite their economic inefficiency?
Why do "flat" organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better?
How does regulatory capture work?
Why do Americans keep shooting one another?
And why is Boris Johnson?

Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions
that draw on alternatives to the *Freakonomics* view of the world---my favorites are [listed here]({{site.github.url}}/reading/).
But asking a programmer who has never done a civics course
to read nine thousand pages about something they're not yet sure is real
is functionally equivalent to telling them to piss off.
We need something that tells a story that coders will feel smarter for having heard.
We need what Sarah Kendzior, Zeynep Tufekci, and N.K. Jemisin would write
if they had six months and some great music to listen to.
Call it *Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code: What Everyone in Tech Needs to Know About Politics, Economics, and Power*,
get *Wired* to tell everyone it's the new new thing,
and you just might change the world.
