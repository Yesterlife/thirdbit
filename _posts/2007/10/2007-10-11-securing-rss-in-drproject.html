David Wolever and Andrew Louis have come up with an interesting way to <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/archives/28-Secure-RSS-with-DrProject.html">provide secure(ish) RSS feeds from DrProject</a>. (See previous posts, e.g. <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/763.html">this one</a>, for background on the problem, or read David's article.) I'd be interested in reactions to their idea.
