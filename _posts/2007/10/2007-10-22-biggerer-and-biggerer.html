The <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">demo and presentation roster for DemoCamp15</a> has been updated; according to David Crow (chief instigator), 300 people have registered to attend.  W00t!  (And: please God, let the wireless and A/V work... ;-))

We'll be heading off to the Duke of York afterward --- hope to see you all then and there.
