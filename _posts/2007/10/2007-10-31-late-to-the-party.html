I've come late to the social networking party --- I mean, I <em>have</em> a social network, I just hadn't webified it until recently.  But the more I think about future directions for DrProject (assuming funding materializes some day), the more I realize that software project management portals are really just specialized social networking sites.  The network might be imposed if you're in a company, and you're more likely to share bug reports than movie preferences, but at their core, both exist to connect people with shared interests to one another in a slightly-less-than-realtime way.

Which makes Google's announcement of its <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/google-opensocial-api-launch.html">OpenSocial API</a> interesting. This is for the also-rans (as the announcement says, Facebook and MySpace are big enough that they can define their own APIs), but anything that makes it easier for people to combine DrProject with other tools has got to be a good thing.  Now, if only more web-based blog readers would support <a href="http://www.openid.org">OpenId</a>...
