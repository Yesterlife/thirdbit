A couple of people have emailed me about getting up to present at DemoCamp.  If you want to, you have to fill in <a href="http://democamp.wufoo.com/forms/democamptoronto15/">this form</a> (which is linked to from <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com">the attendance registration page</a>).  Wise old nuns from Bhutan will examine your proposal pixel by pixel and get back to you in the fullness of time.
