Via Mike Fletcher:

<em>We will be holding our regular PyGTA meeting next Tuesday, the 16th of  October.  Topic proposed is: Continuations, Tasklets, Co-routines and  Micro-threading.  Be the first on your block to be able to say "I broke  my brain with Python!"  This is the ever-so-neat deep-dark  computer-science-y stuff that everyone loves to expand their minds  around while drinking copious quantities of caffeine.
</em>
<em>As usual, we'll gather at the lovely Linux Caffe at the corner of Grace  and Harbord in downtown Toronto, just one block South of Christie  station.  We'll aim to start the meeting at 7:00pm.
