Steve Engels, Karan Singh, and I have posted summaries of what we're going to do with <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1183062014">this year's capstone courses</a>. Long version short, Steve's going to do game design, Karan's going to do  computer animation, and I'm going to set students up as consultants with actual customers.
