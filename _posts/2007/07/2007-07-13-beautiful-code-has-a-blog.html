<a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> now has its own blog, managed by <a href="http://www.michaelfeathers.com/">Michael Feathers</a> (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052"><em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em></a>, which is one of my favorite programming books).  If you'd like to contribute, we'd like to hear from you.
