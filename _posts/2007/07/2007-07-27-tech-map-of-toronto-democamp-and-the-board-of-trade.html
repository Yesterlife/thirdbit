Inspired by this <a href="http://montrealtechwatch.com/images/montrealmap.png">subway map of tech companies in Montreal</a>, <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com/blog/author/jgoldman">Jay Goldman</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperbio.net/">Leila Boujnane</a> are putting together one for Toronto --- see <a href="http://groups.google.ca/group/torcamp/browse_thread/thread/7f181f8ddd5e9c10">this thread</a> for progress to date, and to add information.

On a semi-related note, the <a href="http://bot.com/sub/HomePages/PublicHomePage.asp">Toronto Board of Trade</a> is doing a survey of Information and Communication Technology companies in the GTA to find out more about their needs:
<blockquote>Simply visit <a href="http://www.whatsyouropinion.ca">http://www.whatsyouropinion.ca</a>, enter "TORCAMP" in the field marked Survey Code and follow the easy steps through a short questionnaire which should help us identify issues and opportunities within Toronto's growing ICT community.

For providing us your feedback, we'll send you the aggregate results and analysis, but you'll also be eligible to win a video iPod or tickets to upcoming Technology Innovators Breakfasts at the Toronto Board of Trade.</blockquote>
And finally, <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1633/announcement-democamptoronto14-sept-17-2007">DemoCamp 14</a> will be held at the Board of Trade (1st Canadian Place) on Monday, September 17, starting at 6:00 p.m. --- sign up <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">here</a> to let 'em know you'll be there.
