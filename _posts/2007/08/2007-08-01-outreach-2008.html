On Saturday, Sept. 8th, the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> is organizing a  tri-campus-wide event welcoming all students, staff and faculty to  participate in a day of community service. This day-long opportunity  for community-building underscores the importance the University  attaches to community service, allowing participants the exposure to  wide varieties of service opportunities available throughout the  Greater Toronto Area. Last year, 1,000 participants connected with the  community through various projects such as shoreline cleanup, working  at seniors' residences, painting walls for youth graffiti projects,  and <a href="http://www.habitat.ca/">Habitat for Humanity</a>. If you are interested in joining oUTreach as  a team leader or participant, online registration is now open. Team  leaders will work with community partners to create purposeful  learning opportunities throughout the day of service. You can  participate as an individual or part of a team. Here's your chance to  contribute to the vitality and diversity of Toronto!
