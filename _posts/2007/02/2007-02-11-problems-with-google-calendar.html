I'm using Google Calendar to organize [sic] my life, and have stumbled across an annoying bug.  I maintain two calendars: one for work-related events, and one for my personal life.  I have set sharing on the latter to "Share only my free / busy information (hide details)", but if you view my calendar at:

all you see is items from the first (work) calendar.  I had expected to see the times from the second blocked out as well, without event names or details.  Is this a "feature", or...?
