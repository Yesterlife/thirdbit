Chris Lasher, who audited the Software Carpentry course long-distance last time around, has put together some screencasts to go with the first few lectures:
<ul>
	<li>The shell (<a href="http://gotgenes.com/media/screencasts/swc/shell_cast.avi">AVI</a>, <a href="http://gotgenes.com/media/screencasts/swc/shell_cast.ogg">OGG</a>)</li>
	<li>Subversion (<a href="http://gotgenes.com/media/screencasts/swc/svn_cast.avi">AVI</a>, <a href="http://gotgenes.com/media/screencasts/swc/svn_cast.ogg">OGG</a>)</li>
</ul>
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://gotgenes.com/media/screencasts/swc/shell_cast.avi" />I think this is very cool --- if you have feedback, or want to praise him (hint, hint), please <a href="mailto:chris.lasher@gmail.com">drop him a line</a>.  I would also be interested in hearing how useful you find these --- if there were twenty or thirty covering the whole course, would you actually watch them?  And would they help you understand the course material?
