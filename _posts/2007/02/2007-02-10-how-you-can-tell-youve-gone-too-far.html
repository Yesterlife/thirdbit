Jason Haley's <a href="http://jasonhaley.com/blog/archive/2007/02/10/138005.aspx">most recent post</a> includes a picture of the tables that make up a .NET Assembly's manifest.  I'll reproduce it here to save you clicking on the link:

I don't think there's any way a human being could keep track of this, or fix it if it was broken. On the other hand, I don't believe human beings could make sense of an assembler-level trace of a modern Java application.  The difference, of course, is that we have high-level debuggers for the latter...
