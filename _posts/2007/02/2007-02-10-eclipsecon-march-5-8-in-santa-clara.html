Really wish I could go to <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/">this</a> --- <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, like Linux and Apache, has transformed itself from a tool into an excuse for people doing technically innovative things to hang out and swap ideas.  Or maybe "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca</a>" would be a better analogy, or the early days of Unix, when anything that could consume and produce lines of text could play with so many other tools.  Anyone want to adapt <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a> for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>?
