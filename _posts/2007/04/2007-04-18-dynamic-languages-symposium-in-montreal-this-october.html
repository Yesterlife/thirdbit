A <a href="http://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/dls07/">Dynamic Languages Symposium</a> will be held in Montreal on October 22 (in conjunction with <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/">OOPSLA</a>).  I've put my interest in <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/extensible-programming/">extensible programming</a> on hold to pursue <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/family/">other</a> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson">projects</a>, but I'd still like to attend.  Anyone else planning on going?
