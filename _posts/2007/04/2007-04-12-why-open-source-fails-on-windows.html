Interesting post from Scott Bellware: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/04/11/161702.aspx">"Why Open Source Tools Will Always Fail to Gain Non-Trivial Adoption in the Microsoft Developer Space"</a>. The short answer is "documentation", which is <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>'s greatest weakness.  Gonna have to do something about this...  (And note: I think the only reason it isn't an obstacle on Linux is that Unix programmers have been conditioned to expect less...)<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/04/11/161702.aspx">
