<p>Collections of essays have been around since Montaigne --- my copy of Orwell's is practically falling apart from repeated use. Collecting blog postings is a newer literary form, but as <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/reading.html#spolsky-joel-on-software">Joel Spolsky</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eric-Business-Software-Experts-Voice/dp/1590596234">Eric Sink</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Software-Writing-Selected-Introduced/dp/1590595009">others</a> have shown, it can be equally worthy.</p>
<p>A new entry in this field is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/631016"><em>The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2006</em></a>, which was put together in <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/science_blogging_anthology_the.php">just a few days</a>, and is available through <a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu.com</a>. The essays are all still available online, but I've ordered hardcover --- I still find that makes folding down corners easier ;-).  And if this topic interests you, check out the <a href="http://wiki.blogtogether.org/blogtogether/">North Carolina Science Blogging Conference</a> on January 20.</p>
