Next Wednesday, Jan 31, some of the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ecampbell/undergradProjectShowcase/">undergraduate students</a> who have done research projects in the department will be showing off their stuff.  If you're not racing to finish your CSC407 assignment, please drop by --- it should be a lot of fun.

And the next day, Feb 1, the department is running a showcase of its research activities for local companies.   Descriptions of the projects will be up on the departmental web site (hopefully along with photos) soon after --- I'm looking forward to it.

Update: here's the <a href="http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin6/070124-2899.asp">press release</a> about the second showcase.
