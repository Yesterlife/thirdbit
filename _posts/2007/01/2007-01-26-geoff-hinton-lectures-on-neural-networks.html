Geoffrey Hinton is a professor of computer science with a focus on  artificial intelligence. His research involves investigating ways of  using neural networks for learning, memory, perception and symbol  processing, with over 200 publications in these areas.

Professor Hinton spent three years from 1998 until 2001 setting up the  Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London, and  then returned to the University of Toronto where he holds the Canada  Research Chair in Machine Learning. He is a fellow of the Canadian  Institute for Advanced Research and directs their program on Neural  Computation and Adaptive Perception.

Hinton is a fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Canada,  and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.

He is an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and  Sciences. Hinton has been awarded the IJCAI Award for Research  Excellence, the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award, and the ITAC/NSERC  award for contributions to information technology.

He was named University Professor in 2006.
