Fuji Xerox has built a photocopier that can scan a piece of Japanese text, translate it into Chinese, Korean, or English, then insert the translation in the original layout.  (The actual translation is done over the network on a dedicated translation server.)  <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/">Adam Goucher</a>'s first reaction was, "Substitute code for the original, and get the server to do testing." ;-)
