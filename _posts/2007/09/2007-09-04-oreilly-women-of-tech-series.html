Tatiana Apandi at O'Reilly has organized a series of "<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/womenintech/">Women in Tech</a>" articles, the first of which is now up on the web. The blurb says:
<blockquote>The timely new series reveals the challenges, rewards, and, sometimes, frustrations of being a woman in an industry still dominated by men. "Each day, we'll present a different woman's story that I believe will open readers' eyes to her unique perspective," explains Apandi. "We have contributions from conference organizers, authors, programmers, developers, and more--women who have pioneered prosperous careers in technology."</blockquote>
