OK, not actually "rich", and small-f/small-p on "famous" and "popular", but Adam Goucher is <a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/debugblog/archives/2007/11/five_questions_38.html">interviewed</a> today at DDJ. Adam's who I turn to when I have questions about quality assurance; he comes across as unusually calm in this piece ;-)
