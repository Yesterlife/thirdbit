No time, no time...  Here are some links from the past few weeks that caught my eye:

<dl> <dt><a href="https://zerlot.cse.nd.edu/mywiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">The SourceForge Research Data Archive</a></dt> <dd>A warehouse of information gleaned from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> for use in empirical software engineering research.  There's going to be a full-day <a href="http://www.ric.edu/faculty/ksanders/dcer-sigcse08/index.html">workshop</a> at SIGCSE'08 (Portland, March 2008) on building a similar repository for use in CS education research---perhaps the two efforts could be combined?</dd> <dt>Structure 101 from <a href="http://www.headwaysoftware.com/index.php">Headway Software</a></dt> <dd>Draws pictures of the architecture of complex applications (like <a href="http://chris.headwaysoftware.com/2007/11/spring-25-archi.html">this one</a> of Spring 2.5).  Java and Ada only, unfortunately---I'd really (really) like to have something like this for Python and Ruby.</dd> <dt>The new and improved <a href="http://www.languify.com">Languify</a></dt> <dd>Nicolaas Handojo and Jeff Okawa built the first version as a CSC49X project a couple of years ago; John Green & co. have rebuilt it, and are looking for beta users.  Its purpose is to manage localization for open source projects: groups can post text that needs translation, and volunteers can oblige them.  Give it a whirl...</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=276&thread=214538">Quaere</a></dt> <dd>It calls itself "a domain-specific language for queries in Java", but it relies a lot on embedded strings for control:
<pre>String[] words = {"cherry", "apple", "blueberry"};</pre>
<pre>List sortedWords = asList(</pre>
<pre>from("w").in(words).orderByDescending("w.length()").select("w")</pre>
<pre>);</pre>
Experience with embedded SQL and the like shows that this is very hard to debug.  I'm increasingly convinced that extensible debuggers are a prerequisite for DSLs to go mainstream.</dd> <dt>Titus Brown's <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/">Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry</a> notes</dt> <dd>Along with Brandon King, Chris Lasher, and Rick Wagner, Titus has been one of the major contributors to <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> since it went on the web.  He taught a more advanced course along the same lines last year, and has been generous enough to put his notes up for public use.  I need to fold a lot of this stuff (particularly the material on <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/#packages">packages</a>) into the main notes.</dd> <dt>Webometrics' <a href="http://www.webometrics.info/top4000.asp">World University Rankings</a></dt> <dd>Its creators are up-front about the fact that they're only measuring visibility of web publications (both formal and informal).  Since that's what under-30s care about most, though, it's an important metric.  Toronto is the top Canadian school, in the #28 spot; the only non-US school ahead of it is Cambridge.  (And if you object to their results, feel free to create and apply a different method and publish your findings as well.)</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.lkozma.net/wpv/index.html">WikipediaVision</a></dt> <dd>Someone in Saskatoon just updated the Wikipedia entry on "Hogwarts Houses".  Someone in Edinburgh then updated the entry on "Mr. Blobby", and someone near San Diego revised the entry on Elie Wiesel.  The next two changes were from Malaysia, central Spain, and the middle of Finland (where someone edited the entry on "Niger").  I wonder if there's any way to set this as my screensaver?</dd> <dt><a href="http://code.google.com/edu/tutorials.html">Google Code Tutorials</a></dt> <dd>So far, there are entries on <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/client/index.html">AJAX Programming</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/parallel/index.html">Distributed Systems</a>.</dd> <dt>Tony Redpath's <a href="http://www.marsdd.com/mars/Events/Event-Calendar/Ent101.html">Entrepreneurship 101</a> course at the MaRS Centre in Toronto has a <a href="http://blog.marsdd.com/2007/11/02/entrepreneurship-101-collaborate-online-with-facebook">Facebook group</a></dt> <dd>Cool.  The course is highly recommended.</dd> </dl>
