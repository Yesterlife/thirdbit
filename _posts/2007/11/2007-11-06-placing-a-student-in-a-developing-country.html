An exceptionally talented student of mine would like to spend next summer doing something techy in a developing country.  He knows Linux and networking better than I ever will, works very hard, is perpetually cheerful (at least around me: maybe it's sort of a dipole effect), and would be an asset to any team lucky enough to get him.  We've had a few general pointers ("Why doesn't he do something with OLPC?"), but if you have something more specific --- a name and an email address, for example --- please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">get in touch</a>.
