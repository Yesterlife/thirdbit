Following on from the success of <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>, Google is launching an open source program for pre-university students that will give participants the opportunity to learn more about and contribute to all aspects of open source software development, from writing code and documentation to preparing training materials and conducting user experience research.  If you're a student age 13 or older who has not yet begun university studies, check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/">GHOP</a> site.  Participating projects include Apache, Drupal, GNOME, Joomla!, MoinMoin, Mono, Moodle, Plone, Python, and SilverStripe.
