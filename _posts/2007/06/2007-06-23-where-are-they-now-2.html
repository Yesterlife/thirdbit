The Computer Science department's <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">web site</a> now includes profiles of two ex-49ers: <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/people-profiles-apple.html">Petcharat (Apple) Viriyakattiyaporn</a>, who is starting grad school at <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca">UBC</a> this fall, and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/people-profiles-michelle-levesque.html">Michelle Levesque</a>, who is now in the testing group at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. It's pretty cool to see where our former students wind up, and what they do.
