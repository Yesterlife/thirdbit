Nice <a href="http://blog.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2007/6/13/3019109.html">post</a> from Kim Phelan of <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">TUCOWS</a> about agile product development in general, and TUCOWS' move to agile development in general.  Nice to see this kind of discussion happening in Toronto.
