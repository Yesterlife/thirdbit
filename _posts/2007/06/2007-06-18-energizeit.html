<a href="http://davidcrow.ca">David Crow</a> posted a short summary of Microsoft's <a href="http://energizeit.ca">EnergizeIT</a> weekend show in Toronto earlier today.  I was pleased to see that at least two <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> students went and blogged about <a href="http://thuanta.com/2007/06/17/my-day-spent-at-energizeit-2007/">their</a> <a href="http://gigblog.org/2007/06/17/this-could-be-an-issue/">impressions</a> (and the gender ratio: about 5 out of 60 in one session).  Anyone else get there?
