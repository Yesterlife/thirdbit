Jeff Balogh and David "DC" Cooper have been working on a new ticketing system for DrProject that will allow users to add new fields to tickets on the fly.  Jeff just posted <a href="http://jeffbalogh.wordpress.com/2007/06/07/approximatng-polymorphic-inheritance-with-elixir/">this description</a> of their design, which I think is a pretty elegant solution.  We'd be grateful for comments or suggestions for improvements...
