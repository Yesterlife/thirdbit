<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a> would like to know if there are any <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-07/faculty-programming-contest.html">faculty programming contests</a> out there --- he figures the competition would be less intense than in the student category ;-).  Personally, I'd rather see a hundred-meter proposal writing event, or possibly tag-team marking...
