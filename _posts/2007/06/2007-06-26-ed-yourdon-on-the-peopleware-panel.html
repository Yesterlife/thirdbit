<a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/">Jorge Aranda</a> <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/ed-yourdon-on-the-peopleware-panel/">summarizes</a> <a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2007/05/29/icse-peopleware-panel-session/">Ed Yourdon's description</a> of some back-and-forth with Barry Boehm about software "engineering" and the emphasis on nailing down requirements early during a panel session at <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/icse07/">ICSE'07</a>. I think this kind of distributed conversation is wonderful.
