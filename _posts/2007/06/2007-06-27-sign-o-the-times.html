John Lam reports that <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/steve-yegge-por.html">Steve Yegge has ported Ruby on Rails to Javascript</a>.  Yegge himself seems a little <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">nonplussed by all the fuss</a>, while Joe Gregorio thinks it <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/208/Steve-Yegge-ports-Rails-to-JavaScript">signifies little</a>.  I disagree: I've said for two years that Javascript has a real shot at being the hottest language of 2010, and efforts like this (however misguidedly heroic) are pointers on that road.
