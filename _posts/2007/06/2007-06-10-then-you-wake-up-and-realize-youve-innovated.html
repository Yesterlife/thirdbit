Interesting thought at Artima: <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=207783">will iTunes succeed where Jini failed in making ad hoc networking as "normal"</a>? Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/">Bonjour</a> network does some of the dynamic lookup and connectivity that was at the heart of <a href="http://www.jini.org">Jini</a> (now <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/river/">Apache River</a>, since Sun wasn't making any money from it), but has the advantage of being installed on millions of computers as a side effect of something else. This is exactly the sort of "dog in the kitchen" opportunity that can make someone a fortune...
