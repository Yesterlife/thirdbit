Cool <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/06/blink_completin.html">post</a> from Tim O'Reilly about <a href="http://www.booktwo.org/notebook/the-bluebook/">the 21st Century's equivalent of the electric buggy whip</a> ;-).  (OK, it's actually cooler than that, but I couldn't resist the analogy...)
