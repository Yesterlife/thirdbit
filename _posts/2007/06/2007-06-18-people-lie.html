Interesting story from Bruce Schneier about <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/06/tsa_and_the_sip.html">the "sippy cup incident"</a> --- turns out the blogospheric version of events ain't quite what happened.  As BS points out, though, we're all willing to believe it because we have seen so many of our rights squeezed since 9/11.  Anyone want to take bets whether Canada's no-fly list will be any better run than its American counterpart?
