<a href="http://dev2ops.blogspot.com/2007/10/polling-dev2ops-how-do-you-distribute.html">This poll</a> at <a href="http://www.dev2ops.com">dev2ops.com</a> reminded me that I still have to come up with a lecture on software deployment for next term's CSC301 ("Introduction to Software Engineering").  It's a topic most of the classic texts ignore or skim over, but in my experience, getting software onto people's desktops (or onto the app server, if that's the route you've chosen), and getting it configured, is often as big a challenge as making it work in the first place.

So: what do <em>you</em> do? And what advice would you give someone who's about to start doing it? I'm looking for something between an InstallAnywhere or RPM tutorial, and a hand-waving 10,000-meter overview full of irrefutable banalities.
