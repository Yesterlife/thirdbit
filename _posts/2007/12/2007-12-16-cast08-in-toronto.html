Via Adam Goucher: the <a href="http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/drupal/CAST2008">Third Annual Conference of the Association for Software Testing (CAST)</a> will be held in Toronto on July 14-16, 2008.  The keynote speaker is Gerry Weinberg; the theme is "Beyond the Boundaries: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Software Testing".  Coming as it does on the heels of the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1255.html">announcement</a> that Agile'08 will be here next August, it's shaping up to be quite a summer.
