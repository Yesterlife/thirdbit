Now that Jon Pipitone has unhacked this blog, I can tell you about a new conference from O'Reilly called <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/content/home">Velocity</a>, happening on June 23-24, 2008 at the San Francisco Airport Marriott in Burlingame, California:
<blockquote>Web companies, big and small, face many of the same challenges: sites must be faster, infrastructure needs to scale, and everything must be available to customers at all times, no matter what. Velocity is the place to obtain the crucial skills and knowledge to build successful web sites that are fast, scalable, resilient, and highly available.</blockquote>
