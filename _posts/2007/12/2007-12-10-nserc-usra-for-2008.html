Every year, Canada's <a href="http://www.nserc.ca">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council</a> provides hundreds of scholarships to give undergraduates a chance to spend a summer working with a professor on a research project.  My first programming job was a USRA for Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~akl/">Selim Akl</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca">Queen's</a> in 1982, and many other faculty and grad students have done USRAs as well. An announcement has just been <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1197321532">posted</a> with details for the 2008 program; if you're in CS at U of T, interested in software engineering, meet the criteria, and would like to find out what research is all about, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson_at_cs.toronto.edu">give me a shout</a>.
