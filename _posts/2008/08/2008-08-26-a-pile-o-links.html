Accumulated while on holiday---funny how sometimes I used this blog as an external strap-on memory pack.
<ul>
	<li>There's a workshop on "<a href="http://home.segal.uvic.ca/~IRCoSE-2008/">Infrastructure for Research in Collaborative Software Engineering</a>" atFSE in Atlanta this November.  Its aim is "...sharing  experiences in evaluating and using open-source, academic, and commercial choices to conduct  research, showcase how choices helped accelerate their work, and identify areas for improvement."</li>
	<li>Emma Jane Hogbin had <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/emmajane/form-an-orderly-queue-ladies-oscon-2008/">a few things to say</a> at OSCON this year about women in open source.</li>
	<li>The winner of the 26th Annual Bulwer-Lytton Contest (for best bad opening line) has been <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080814.wbulwer0814/BNStory/Entertainment/home">announced</a>. My favorite is still a non-winner from the early 1990s: "His eyes were cold and hard, which made them exceptionally difficult to chew."</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/306-the-genetic-map-of-europe/">genetic map of Europe</a>.</li>
	<li>A new <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/2008/08/18/classtellcom-online-class-websites/">CMS for building class websites</a>, cool in part because its creator is 15 years old.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.torontotechweek.com/index.htm">Toronto Tech Week</a> is Sept 22-26.</li>
	<li>The Linux Foundation has published a <a href="http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/how-participate-linux-community">guide to kernel development</a> that makes a nice companion to Karl Fogel's <a href="http://www.producingoss.com/"><em>Producing Open Source Software</em></a>.</li>
	<li>Lambda the Ultimate <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2941">discusses</a> Ronad Loui's "<a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.228">In Praise of Scripting</a>" (freely readable draft <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~loui/praiseieee.html">here</a>).</li>
	<li>Ontario's Privacy Commissioner is hosting a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/21/facebook-conference.html">one-day conference</a> for high school and university students about how much of your life (not) to put online. See also the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>'s article "<a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3251/when-professors-create-social-networks-for-classes-some-students-see-a-creepy-treehouse">When Professors Create Social Networks for Classes, Some Students See a 'Creepy Treehouse'</a>".</li>
	<li>And finally, a <a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2008/04/19/homemade-coffee-printer/">latte printer</a> you can make at home.</li>
</ul>
More later, including final wrap-up on Google Summer of Code projects.
