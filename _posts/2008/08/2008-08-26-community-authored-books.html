<blockquote>O'Reilly is creating a new line of "community-authored" books. One of them is called "97 Thing Every Software Architect Should Know"... All of the "97 Things" books will be created by wiki, with the best entries being selected from all the wiki contributions.</blockquote>
The <a href="http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki">whole wiki</a> makes for interesting (if uneven) reading.
