<a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>'s wiki parser has reached---in fact, passed---the point of no return.  We tried replacing it a couple of years ago, but the results were <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/527.html">disappointing</a>.  I'm now thinking about trying again using <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> to generate a (Python) parser.  Yes, it means developers will have to use a Java tool in development, but (a) I hope that only a few people will ever need to muck with the parsing (we'll check in the generated grammar), and (b) as far as I can tell,the pure-Python alternatives are not as well developed, documented, or supported.  Plus, this gives me an excuse to do some coding---it's been three and a half years, and I'd like to contribute <em>something</em> to <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> besides bugs.  I'm starting in on the documentation now; if you're in Toronto, and consider yourself an <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> whiz, please drop me a line.
