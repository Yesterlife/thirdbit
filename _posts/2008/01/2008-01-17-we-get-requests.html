As I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1309.html">mentioned</a> a few days ago, we've started converting <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>'s interface to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a>.  We like the look and feel a lot, but were finding it very slow (several seconds per page, rather than half a second).  Alex Russell was kind enough to explain what we were doing wrong, and to give me permission to post his explanation <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc49x/DrProject/wiki/HowToMakeDojoFaster">on the DrProject wiki</a>.
