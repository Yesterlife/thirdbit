title: "Portals on Gears?"

Optimistic version control systems like CVS and Subversion allow people to decouple their work: instead of simultaneously editing the master copy of a file (and stomping on one another's changes), each player changes a local copy, then merges it into the repository.  In contrast, most ticketing systems still use the "everything's on the server" model: there's no notion of a "local" copy of the ticket database.

But <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> has got me thinking: could we build portals like <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> and <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> on a "write then merge" platform?  Would it improve performance?  Scaling?  Usability?  Or is it just a hammer looking for a walnut?  Any MSc students looking for a project out there?
