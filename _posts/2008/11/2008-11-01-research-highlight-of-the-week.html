...the CRA and CCC web sites are now providing a weekly feature called "Computing Research Highlight of the Week". If you are doing computing research, you are invited to submit your own work for possible inclusion in this weekly feature.

These highlights are designed to provide easily digestible, compelling nuggets of computing research work. Members of Congress, the Administration, and funding agency managers and directors are some of the main audiences for these web pages. We believe the highlights should also prove to be useful for the entire research community.
