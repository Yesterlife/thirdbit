The folks who run the <a href="http://hacklab.to">Hacklab</a> in Toronto's Kensington Market have an <a href="http://hacklab.to/archives/unpatched-tuesdays/">open lab night every Tuesday</a>.  Everyone is welcome: come on out, see what's what, and meet some very friendly people. And don't worry about being a newbie---they all were once too.
