One of our project students has a weird problem with Rails --- if you have an answer (weird or otherwise), we'd like to hear from you.
<ul>
	<li>I want to send an AJAX request to the server using POST.</li>
	<li>Rails is supposed to handle parameter passing, placing all parameters in the params hash.</li>
	<li>When I use Ajax.Request using POST, the variables that I'm passing are not reaching the params hash.</li>
	<li>It works with GET though!</li>
</ul>
If I do:
<pre>render :text =&gt; request.inspect</pre>
I can see my POST parameters in @parameters in the request object, but somehow these aren't making it to my params hash.

And here's the kicker: parameters pass just fine on my partner's laptop.  So I've pinned it down to either a problem with my Rails installation, or a problem with my version of OLM.  A complete purge and reinstall of Rails hasn't helped.  Neither has a complete reload of the code from the repository.

<em>Later: problem solved --- <a href="http://olmonrails.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/prototypeajaxrequest-rails-solved/">it was Firebug's fault</a>.
