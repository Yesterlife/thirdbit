Oh dear --- I have fallen behind again.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://myttc.ca/">MyTTC.ca</a> is up (<a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/myttcca/">Jorge's comments</a> are more coherent than mine). Should this be the starting point for student projects in my fall CSC301 Software Engineering course?</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/map/">science maps at Eigenfactor</a> are pretty cool --- <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/07/exploring_the_eigenfactor_1.html">this post</a> talks about what's going on behind the scenes.</li>
	<li>How much of your code is comments?  Meaningful identifiers?  Spacing?  Better yet, which open source project are you <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20080626/">most like</a>?</li>
	<li>Jon Udell is <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/07/22/net-enhanced-democracy-amazing-progress-solvable-challenges/">watching you</a>, Senator Sununu.</li>
	<li>And finally, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/07/stiglitz_and_sulston_who_owns.html">who owns science?</a></li>
</ul>
