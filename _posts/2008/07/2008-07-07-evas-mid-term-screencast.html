Eva Wong was out of town for the mid-term demos last Friday, so she made a <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/hackystat-wong-2008-07.wmv">screencast</a> instead. It's pretty cool---and the live demos just plain rocked.  I'm constantly impressed by how much students can do when they're given real challenges, and a chance to focus on them.
