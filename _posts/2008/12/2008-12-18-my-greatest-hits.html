According to Google Analytics, my most popular blog posts are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000174.html">Interviewing at Google</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/292.html">Why Bad Software Exists</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/863.html">The first public announcement of <em>Beautiful Code</em></a></li>
</ul>
My recommended reading list (now somewhat out of date) and CV (ditto) are fourth and fifth in my personal popularity list.
