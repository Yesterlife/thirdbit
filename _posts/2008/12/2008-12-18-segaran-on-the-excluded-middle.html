<a href="http://blog.kiwitobes.com/?p=59">Nice post</a> from Toby Segaran (author of a very good book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325/"><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em></a>) that discusses the "excluded middle" of technical books---worth reading if you're thinking about writing anything for the geek market.
