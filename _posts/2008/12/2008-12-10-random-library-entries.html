As <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1554.html">I noted back in May</a>, I'm using <a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> to keep track of my reading these days.  The "<a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/recommended-reading">Library</a>" tab on my site now displays a random selection of books that I've enjoyed; hope you enjoy 'em too.
