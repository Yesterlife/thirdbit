Brian Hayes' latest column for <a href="http://www.amsci.org"><em>American Scientist</em></a> is now <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2008/4/the-britney-spears-problem">online</a>, and he has posted <a href="http://bit-player.org/2008/bloom-filtered-britney">supplementary material</a> in his blog.  The problem he's looking at this month is how to count a potentially infinite number of values using finite space; I think there's probably a good CS assignment in here :-).
