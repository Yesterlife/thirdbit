Last summer we organized several pizza lunches at which people from local companies, and faculty from the department, could chat with our intern students.  They were a lot of fun: the students learned a lot about possible future careers, and what they could be doing now to prep for them, while the guests left knowing more about what to expect from our graduates (and in some cases, which ones to pursue).

I'm organizing similar lunches this summer. If you'd like to chat with 15-20 talented undergrads for an hour or so, please let me know (gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu).
