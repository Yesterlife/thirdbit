Baron Schwartz has put up a lengthy post describing <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/06/15/what-is-it-like-to-write-a-technical-book/">what it's like to write a technical book</a> (which I found through Matt Doar's smaller, but more graphical, <a href="http://toolsmiths.blogspot.com/2008/06/response-to-what-is-it-like-to-write.html">post</a>).  I'm doing this for the fifth time right now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Scientific-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262231867">two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Crunching-Everyday-Problems-Python/dp/0974514071">solo</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Programming-Scientific-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262731185">two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047">edited</a>, the current one collaborative).  I haven't been keeping a word count log for this one, but I did for <em>Data Crunching</em> (and I used to for my fiction, back when I was actually writing some), and I found it a great way to keep myself honest.  I also found the big downward spikes showing days when I did nothing but rip out inadequate text rather therapeutic... :-)
