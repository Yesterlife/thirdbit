<a href="http://gambit.mit.edu/loadgame/audiodyssey.php">AudiOdyssey</a> (via <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/20880020">DDJ</a>) is "...an experimental computer game designed to be accessible to both the visually impaired community and mainstream gamers. The user stars as Vinyl Scorcher, an up-and-coming DJ, on his quest to get club patrons dancing. Swinging the Nintendo Wii controller to the beat, Vinyl lays down the various component tracks of a song, and keeps the party jumping. If he [sic] does an especially good job, he [sic] can even freestyle! But beware---if dancers get too rowdy, they're likely to bump into the turntables, messing up Vinyl's tracks."
