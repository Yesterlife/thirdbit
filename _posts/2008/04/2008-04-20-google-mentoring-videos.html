Google has started offering coaching to most of their employees, and I've been lucky enough to be approved as one of their coaches.  They recently sponsored a series of talks given by their coaches and they have posted videos of these talks up on YouTube.  My talk is about patterns I've seen when coaching technical women, and suggestions around how we can handle these common issues.

If you are interested, you can access the the talks by going to YouTube.com and searching for "Google techtalks coaching".  There are currently six talks there, including one that I gave.  Here are the topics:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUqL2p94XMc">Accomplishing More By Doing Less</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mVv9tvSIA">Leading from Strength: Making a Difference</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVs9CD5uVwg">What Tech Women Really Want</a> (Dorward's)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTyr0x5J7xc">Impactful Communication</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eJ2w1u2o0A">Create the Career You Want</a></li>

</ul>
