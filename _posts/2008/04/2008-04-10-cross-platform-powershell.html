I knew it would happen sooner rather than later: there is now <a href="http://igorshare.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/pash-cross-platform-powershell-is-out-in-the-wild-announcement/">an open source reimplementation of Microsoft PowerShell</a> that will run on all the "other" platforms.  If you haven't played with PowerShell, it's the coolest thing to happen to coding in a long time; there's also the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hotwire-shell/">Hotwire</a> hypershell (written and scripted in Python), and I'm sure more will come along.
