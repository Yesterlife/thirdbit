<a href="http://www.ubc.ca">UBC</a>, <a href="http://www.uvic.ca">UVic</a>, and <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">SFU</a> are hosting this year's "<a href="http://www.risingstars.ubc.ca/">Rising Stars of Research</a>" showcase on August 21-23.  Its poster competition is a chance for undergraduates to show off their research in Health Sciences, Biochemistry &amp; Cellular Biology, Natural Resources &amp; the Environment, Life Sciences &amp; Psychology, Computational Sciences &amp; Technology, and Physical &amp; Earth Sciences.  I'd love to check it out, and I'll actually be in BC around then for a wedding, but since it's mine, I'm going to have to pass...
