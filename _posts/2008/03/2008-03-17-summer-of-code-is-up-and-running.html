Leslie Hawthorn has <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/03/meet-your-mentors.html">announced</a> the list of <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">blessed organizations</a> for this year's Summer of Code.  The next three weeks are crucial: if you're a student, read the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html">FAQ</a>, then <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html">READ THE FAQ</a>, then get onto the mailing lists and IRC channels, watch for a couple of days to learn the rules of the road, then dive in and get yourself noticed.  David Janes, Blake Winton, Karen Reid, Jennifer Campbell, Paul Gries, Jason Montojo, and I are putting forward projects for <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode">Python</a>, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2008_Ideas">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code_2008">XMPP</a> (formerly known as Jabber), and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/summer-code-2008/summer-code-project-ideas">Dojo</a>; there's a triple ton of other stuff out there too, so really, what are you waiting for?
