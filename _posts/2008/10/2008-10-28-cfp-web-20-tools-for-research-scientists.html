Via <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/10/28/call-for-submissions-for-a-project-on-the-use-and-relevance-of-web-20-tools-for-researchers/">Science in the Open</a>, a call for expressions of interest in running a research project on <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/24359/RIN_half_page_311.pdf">how Web 2.0 tools are changing scientific practice</a>. Given the timelines (EoI's on November 3, project to start in December) it'll be hard to get a proposal in, but it'll be interesting to see what comes out the other end.
