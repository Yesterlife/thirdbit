Computers are as important to modern scientists as test tubes, but we know surprisingly little about how scientists develop and use software in their research.  To find out, the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="http://www.simula.no">Simula Research Laboratory</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/">National Research Council of Canada</a> have launched an online survey in conjunction with <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org"><cite>American Scientist</cite></a> magazine. If you have 20 minutes to take part, please go to:

We'd also be grateful if you'd spread the word through any mailing lists, blogs, or bulletin boards you have access to.  Thanks for your help!
