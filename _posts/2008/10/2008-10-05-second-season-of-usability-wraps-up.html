The second Season of Usability just wrapped up; Ellen Reitmayr has posted a <a href="http://season.openusability.org/index.php/2008/10/04/season-of-usability-2008-final-report/">summary</a>, along with a description of the excellent work that Liz Blankenship did on <a href="http://season.openusability.org/index.php/2008/10/04/success-stories-08-redesigning-drprojects-administration-interface/">DrProject's administration interface</a>.  It was a tremendous help --- they're already soliciting mentors, sponsors, projects, and students for next year.
