Via <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~paullu">Paul Lu</a> (who is coaching the <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>'s team), a nice writeup on <a href="http://insidehpc.com/2008/10/21/insidetrack-sc08-cluster-challenge-teams/">the teams competing in this year's Cluster Challenge</a>:
<blockquote>...teams are made of...six of undergraduate students, a supervising professor and a partnering HPC vendor.  The students will architect a machine with the support of their respective vendor organization...constrain[ed] to a single rack powered by two 120-volt, 20-amp circuits... The teams are required to run a series of standard applications and benchmarks [and are] judged on based on workload accomplishment, benchmark performance and the overall system architecture.</blockquote>
It's a pretty cool project, and it says a lot about the pace of change in our business that what was once a publication-worthy venture is now something that undergrads can do for fun.  I wish all the teams the best of luck.

And speaking of the University of Alberta, I'll be speaking there on Monday, November 24 --- look forward to seeing some old students and friends.
