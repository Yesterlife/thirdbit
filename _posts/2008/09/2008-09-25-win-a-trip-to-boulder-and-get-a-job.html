From <a href="http://boulder.me">http://boulder.me</a>:
<blockquote>Want a FREE trip to beautiful Boulder, Colorado? The Boulder tech scene is growing like crazy. Twenty of our top tech startups have banded together to fly in one hundred top software developers, programmers and engineers from across the country, all expenses paid. You <a href="http://boulder.me/boulder-startup-job-fair/">can apply</a> to be one of the hundred.</blockquote>
