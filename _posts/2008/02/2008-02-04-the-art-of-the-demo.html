Teams in my <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/consulting-2008-01">consulting course</a> are required to put together 5-minute videos showing off their work.  As examples, I've pointed them at <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/2008/02/01/canadian-demogods/">this post</a> from <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/">StartupNorth</a>; of course there's always the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">15-minute screencast</a> that launched <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">RubyOnRails</a>, and the content at <a href="http://www.showmedo.com/">ShowMeDo</a>.  if you know of other good demo videos, please add comments.
