And now <a href="http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2008/02/sounds-like-summer.html">it's official</a>: the Google Summer of Code 2008 web page is up at <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">http://code.google.com/soc/2008/</a>.  If you're not familiar with the program, Google provides $5000 grants for full-time university students to work on open source projects, which are mentored by people affiliated with literally dozens of different <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">open source organizations</a>.  The <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html">FAQ</a> should answer most questions; as in past years, I'll be proposing some projects, and looking for students to mentor.  They will begin accepting applications from  mentoring organizations on Monday, March 3, and student  applications on Monday, March 24th.
