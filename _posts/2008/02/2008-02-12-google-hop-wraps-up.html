Google's Highly Open Participation project (a high school equivalent of Summer of Code) has just <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/02/announcing-grand-prize-winners-for.html">wrapped up</a>, and the ten grand prize winners have <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/grandprize.html">been announced</a>.  Congratulations to everyone involved---it was a great idea, and I hope Toronto can be involved next time around.
