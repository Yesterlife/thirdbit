<a href="http://www.velocity.uwaterloo.ca/">VeloCity</a> calls itself a "mobile + media incubator", but <a href="http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2008/jan/02we.html">the reality</a> is more interesting: it's a residence building at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a> that is being set aside for students with an entrepreneurial bent and an interest in new media and mobile computing.  It will undoubtedly be mocked as a frat house for would-be Baby Bills, but I think it's a great idea, and I'm keen to see how it plays out.
