Via Jeff Balogh, a pointer to <a href="http://hotwire-shell.org/">Hotwire Shell</a>, a free object-oriented hypershell inspired by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</a> that runs on Linux, and is being ported to Windows and Mac OS X.  The principal author seems to be <a href="http://cgwalters.livejournal.com/">Colin Walters</a>; I'll post more info as I get it.
