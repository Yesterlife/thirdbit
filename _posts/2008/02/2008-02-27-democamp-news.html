I had to cut out of <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/02/22/demos-and-ignite-presentations-at-mondays-democamp/">DemoCamp 17</a> early on Monday night to catch a train, but:
<ol>
	<li>My students said it went well.</li>
	<li>So did the <a href="http://globalnerdy.com/2008/02/27/democamp-17-covered-in-the-national-post/"><em>National Post</em></a>.</li>
	<li>There's going to be a <a href="http://www.ice08.com/about/democamp">DemoCamp session at ICE'08</a> --- deadline for proposals is March 14, and we hope to see lots of you there.</li>
</ol>
