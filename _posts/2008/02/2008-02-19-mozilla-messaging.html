David Ascher has announced <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/02/19/mozilla-messaging/">the launch of Mozilla Messaging</a>, a new Mozilla Foundation subsidiary that wants to reinvent email and internet communication.  It's an increasingly crowded space, but if anyone can pull it together, the Moz folks can.
