The <a href="http://www.astc.org/">Association of Science-Technology Centers</a>, "...<span class="content">an organization of science centers and museums dedicated to furthering                the public understanding of science...",</span> is having its <a href="http://blog.marsdd.com/2008/05/27/science-centres-inspiring-a-culture-of-innovation/">triennial conference</a> in Toronto in June. I'd love to wander around the exhibits...
