Dmitri is <a href="http://slashid.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/captains-log-stardate-80528/">still struggling</a> with Google's web toolkit---in particular, with trying to debug code that's throwing an exception for unknown reasons. Maybe we could pass a new law---nobody's allowed to release a library, framework, language, or other [name goes here] without including debugger support... *sigh*
