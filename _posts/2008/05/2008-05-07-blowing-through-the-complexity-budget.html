<a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2008/05/when_should_you_jump_jsr_308_t.html">Good post</a> from Michael Nygard (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213"><em>Release It!</em></a>) on when to get off the Java train.  His answer is now: as bad as generics were, the typing rules in JSR 308 add yet another huge dollop of complexity.  I'm not convinced that freely-typed languages are the solution, but they're sure looking more and more attractive...
