<a href="http://www.ubietylab.net/">Todd Veldhuizen</a>'s <a href="http://www.ubietylab.net/ubigraph/index.html">UbiGraph</a> dynamic graph visualization software is now available.  The <a href="http://www.ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Demos/index.html">demos</a> are very cool (though they could use a soundtrack); you should give it a try.
