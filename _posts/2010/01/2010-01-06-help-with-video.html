With the first decade of the 21st Century safely out of the way, I figure it's time to start learning how to do this video stuff I keep seeing on the interweb. Two items I've found very useful so far are:
<ol>
	<li>Dan Meyer's "<a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=5549">Professional Conference Video With Semi-Professional Equipment</a>". Producing something watchable will always take a lot of work, but these shortcuts will reduce the pain.</li>
	<li>"<a href="http://hillside.net/plop/2009/papers/People/A%20Pattern%20Language%20for%20Screencasting.pdf">A Pattern Language for Screencasting</a>" by Nicholas Chen and Maurice Rabb. Lots of good ideas here, nicely organized.</li>
</ol>
