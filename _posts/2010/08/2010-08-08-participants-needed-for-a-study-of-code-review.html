Andrew Smith, a graduate student I have been working with, is looking for people to <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/masters/2010/08/08/call-for-participants/">take part in a study</a>:
<blockquote>...to determine what advantages and disadvantages three types of  code review tools have.

As a participant you would spend about an hour doing 3 code reviews (20 minutes each):
<ul>
	<li>One on paper, just like marking in the good old days.</li>
	<li>One using ReviewBoard, a popular code review tool.</li>
	<li>One using a Tablet PC, with custom-built software.</li>
</ul>
No code review or marking experience is required, all that you need is to be familiar with either C or Java.</blockquote>
If you can spare an hour, we'd both be grateful for your help.
