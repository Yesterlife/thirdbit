As Mark Guzdial <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/the-first-language-independent-valid-measure-of-cs1-knowledge-allison-tew-defends/">recently reported</a>, Allison Tew has successfully defended her PhD thesis at Georgia Tech. For her thesis, she constructed <em>and validated</em> a language-independent measure of CS-1 knowledge. I'll post again when her test becomes available---I can't wait to see it (and use it in <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>).
