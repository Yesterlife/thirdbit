Summer School on Mining Software Repositories
http://msrcanada.org/school/
June 9-12, 2010.
Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.
Sponsored by MITACS.

The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes the rich data available in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects. It has gained popularity since 2004 with the first instance of the MSR workshop (now conference) and continues to be one of the fastest growing fields in the area of software engineering.

This summer school will provide students with opportunities to learn the background needed to excel in this emerging and important field. For researchers, the summer school offers a platform to discuss and collaborate on the future of the MSR field. The summer school is also an opportunity for industry to learn how to adopt MSR ideas in practice. The speakers are leading experts on MSR from academia and industry.
