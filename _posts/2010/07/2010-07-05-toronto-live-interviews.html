A new event series is starting up: Toronto Live Interviews.  The first is on Tuesday, July 20, 6:30pm - 8:00pm, at the Centre for Social Innovation, Room 120 (215 Spadina Ave).

Tickets are free, but please register as space is limited: for information and registration, see <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/25203">http://guestlistapp.com/events/25203</a>.

The guest, Karl Schroeder, is an award-winning science fiction author. He's a world-builder able to convincingly juxtapose high and low tech. He goes beyond Arthur C Clarke's idea that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" to understand the worldview, philosophy and economy of people living in these magical possible futures. In his work as a foresight consultant and environmental blogger, he flips these perspectives around to understand how we can make a future we want to live in.

Karl will be interviewed by Jen Dodd. Jen is a physicist, designer of public science events including SciBarCamp and Perimeter Institute's Quantum to Cosmos Festival, and is now managing director of Subtle Technologies, Toronto's annual festival of art and science.

Location instructions: on arriving at 215 Spadina, go through the Dark Horse cafe to the lobby, go up the stairs to the left of the elevator, and room 120 is through the glass doors straight ahead.
