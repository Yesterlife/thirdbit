Jamie and Jim at <a href="http://www.scimatic.com/">Scimatic</a> have released <a href="http://www.scimatic.com/samples">Samples</a>, a tool for managing experimental results, and have <a href="http://www.scimatic.com/node/325">blogged</a> about what it's good for. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.gridcentric.ca">GridCentric</a> team are talking more about <a href="http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/01/copper-10-on-its-way.html">Copper</a>, their cluster operating system product. It's great to see a couple of local startups creating such cool technology---best of luck to both.
