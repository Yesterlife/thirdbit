<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">Google Summer of Code 2010</a> is now up and running. Mentoring organizations can apply March 8-12, and students can apply March 29-April 9 (but should start working on their applications as soon as the list of organizations is announced). The University of Toronto has always been a strong presence in GSoC---here's hoping 2010 is the best year yet. I'm particularly hoping that some <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">UCOSP</a> students will shoot for spots.
