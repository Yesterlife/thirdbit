The <a href="http://www.hfoss.org/hfoss2010/">second annual HFOSS</a> is taking place March 10 in Milwaukee (along with <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2010/">SIGCSE 2010</a>). F&amp;OS communities helped save a lot of lives after the Haiti disaster, and many of the social and technical tools developed for it (and earlier, Katrina) are being used right now to help Chile; hope to see a strong turnout.
