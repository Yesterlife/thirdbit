I needed a long-form birth certificate to renew my daughter's passport, so I went onto the Ontario government website, filled in the form, ticked the box saying "regular delivery (15 business days)", gave them my credit card information, and clicked "submit".  Three days later I get a letter:
<blockquote>Dear Applicant,

Upon review of your application or request, additional information is required.

The payment that has been received is not sufficient to pay for the products and services that you requested. Please forward a further payment of $10.00 so that the ORG can continue processing your request.</blockquote>
Huh? I filled in <em>their</em> form---they calculated how much I owe. And they have my email address---why send a printed letter? Government 2.0 feels like it's still a long way away...
