I prefer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VscVP_Gt_s">Peggy Lee</a>'s version of the song to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpn_xu81ySo">Bette Midler</a>'s; I wonder if Mark Guzdial thought of either when he wrote <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-standard-for-online-courses-is-firmly-in-place/">this post</a> a couple of days ago:
<blockquote>Surely, this can't be <em>it</em>---it can't be that Sakai + Twitter + a blog or Wiki is what all future studies will call the "traditional" form of online courses?</blockquote>
It's worth checking out some of the tools he links to: there's a revolution waiting to happen here, and I'd really like to be part of it.
