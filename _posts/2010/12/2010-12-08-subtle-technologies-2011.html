Subtle Technologies Symposium 2011

Toronto, June 2&ndash;5, 2011

Submission deadline: December 12, 2010

(Submissions require only a title, abstract and CV.)

In 2011 The Subtle Technologies Festival celebrates its 14th year of bringing people together to promote wonder, incite creativity and spark innovation across disciplines. Through symposia, exhibitions, workshops, screenings and performances we provide a forum to pose and explore questions and inspire work that bridges the gap between science and art.

Scientists who have attended Subtle Technologies have said:
<blockquote>"Refreshing and a breath of fresh air.... Unique event of the highest quality that should not be missed." -Sema Sgaier (geneticist and photographer)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"I thought the diversity and depth of talks at Subtle Technologies were outstanding and I will highly recommend the conference to my scientific colleagues" -Scott Menary (physicist, York University)</blockquote>
For the exhibition and performance portion of our program we typically showcase work that is engaging and technology based. Our symposium is made up of presentations, demonstrations and panel discussions that range from 15 to 45 minutes in length. Possible areas to be explored at the 2011 Festival from either a scientific or artistic approach include:
