The Jolt Awards for best software (and book) are back: <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/joltawards/225600433">this page</a> on the <em>Doctor Dobb's Journal</em> site has the schedule and categories.  It's a shame that neither of the collections I'm helping edit right now (one on evidence-based software engineering, the other on the architecture of open source applications) will be in print in time to qualify this year, but there's always 2011 :-)
