The announcement is a couple of weeks old now (I'm still juggling things as I transition from <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> to <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/">Software Carpentry</a>), but Google has released <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/04/dont-copy-this-code.html">some deliberately bad code to help teach software security</a>. Very cool idea; it certainly raises the bar for our work...  There's more material <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/security/index.html">here</a> as well.
