My Google Summer of Code student, Chas Leichner, started his project this week. His aim is to build a "record, annotate, and replay" extension for IDLE, so that instructors can create program walkthroughs for students. We think this will be better than simple screencasts because they'll be interactive: if a student wants to explore an alternative execution path partway through a replay, or look at some values that the instructor hadn't thought to show, she'll already be in the IDE. (For a rough-and-ready look at what we have in mind, check out Geoff Salmon's <a href="http://runwikirun.appspot.com/">web-based prototype</a>.)

Chas is blogging at <a href="http://cleichner.blogspot.com/">http://cleichner.blogspot.com/</a>, and his first three posts discuss:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cleichner.blogspot.com/2010/05/on-code-reading.html">code reading</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cleichner.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-i-thought-i-would-be-doing-today.html">scriptable debuggers</a>, and</li>
	<li><a href="http://cleichner.blogspot.com/2010/05/these-are-my-designs-for-command.html">some designs for annotations</a></li>
</ul>
We'd welcome comments, particularly on the third post: how instructors add comments or directions to recorded program execution traces is going to be <em>the</em> key determinant of this tool's usability.
