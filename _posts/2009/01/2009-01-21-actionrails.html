Mike Gunderloy and others have announced <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2009/01/20/announcing-actionrails/">the foundation of ActionRails</a>, a Ruby on Rails consultancy for people who need more than "PHP with attitude".  Mike gets more done in the average week than I get done in the average year; if you need serious help, they can seriously help you.
