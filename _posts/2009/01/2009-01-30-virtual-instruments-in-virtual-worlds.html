From Intel's Research blog, a post about <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/research/2009/01/sciencesim.php">ScienceSim</a> (a virtual world in which you can build scientific instruments).  If I had more energy, I'd include a link to William Gibson saying that our children will find our distinction between the real and the virtual quaint.
