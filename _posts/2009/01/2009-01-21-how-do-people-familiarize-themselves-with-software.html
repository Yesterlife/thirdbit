One of my grad students, Jason Montojo, has posted a brief description of his intended research topic: <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/?p=41">how people familiarize themselves</a> with code bases they haven't seen before.  I'm sure he'd be grateful for your thoughts...

Meanwhile, Alecia Fowler has posted a few links about <a href="http://ajfowler.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/tactile-maps/">tactile maps</a> for the visually disabled. I was fascinated by the felt maps fire wardens used in London during the Blitz to find their way around in the dark; neat that high tech is finally catching up :-).
