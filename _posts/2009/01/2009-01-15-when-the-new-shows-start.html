For Canadians who are as frustrated as I am by how hard it is to find out when TV shows restart this winter:
<ul>
	<li><em>Battlestar Galactica</em> premieres tomorrow (Friday, Jan 16).</li>
	<li><em>Chuck</em> returns Thursday, Feb 5 (moves to 10:00 pm).</li>
	<li><em>Stargate:Atlantis</em> starts on March 29th.</li>
	<li><em>Eureka</em> will start as soon as the Sci Fi Channel announces their dates.</li>
</ul>
