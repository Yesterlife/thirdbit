<ul>
	<li><a href="http://futurity.org/">Futurity.org</a> is an "online news source featuring the latest discoveries in science, engineering, the environment, health, and more from North America's leading research universities."  The list of <a href="http://futurity.org/about/">participating universities</a> is impressive, and the signal-to-noise ratio has been pretty high so far (if you're a science geek like me, anyway). McGill seems to be the only Canadian university participating...</li>
	<li>You've probably already seen <a href="http://www.good.is/post/african-dynamo/">William Kamkwamba's story</a>; if not, take six minutes and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arD374MFk4w&amp;feature=player_embedded">watch the video</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.stodden.net/2009/10/04/my-interview-with-itconversations-on-reproducible-research/">Jon Udell interviewed Victoria Stodden</a> last week on the subject of reproducible research---well worth a listen.</li>
	<li>Interesting analysis by <em>Nature</em> of various countries' <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/10/post_48.html">research footprints</a>. The curve for China is particularly impressive.</li>
	<li>How and why did Django become the most popular Python web programming framework? The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515324/history-of-djangos-popularity">story</a> reveals a lot about how open source projects succeed and fail (and how much random chance plays a part).</li>
	<li>The Opera (web browser) folks have created a <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Web Standards Curriculum</a> for educators.</li>
	<li>Who is Octan? How much are they contributing to climate change? Now you can <a href="http://www.frankieroberto.com/weblog/708">find out</a>...</li>
</ul>
