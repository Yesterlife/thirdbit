	<li>Last week, MaRS <a href="http://blog.marsdd.com/2009/09/29/social-venture-registry-launched/">announced</a> an <a href="http://www.marsdd.com/mars/About-MaRS/Partners/sig/socialentrepreneurs">Ontario Social Venture Registry</a>. If the Government 2.0 consulting course runs again, I'll be checking it to find clients.</li>
	<li>HomeZilla has posted an <a href="http://homezilla.ca/blog/homezillas-open-data-wish-list/">open data wish list</a> that refers back to <a href="http://myownpirateradio.com/2009/09/16/open-data-whats-on-your-wish-list/">Osh Momoh's list</a>. Nice to have the people who are using the data saying what they want and why.</li>
	<li>Mark Faul has posted a very incomplete <a href="http://markfaul.ca/2009/09/29/open-data-initiatives/">index of open data projects </a>around the world.</li>
	<li>Then there's the <a href="http://mashupaustralia.org/">MashupAustralia competition</a>---I hope we'll be in a position to do something similar for Canada in six months.</li>
</ul>
