U of T's Aran Donohue has created <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ad/news/">Academic Hacker News</a>, and response has been very good: as he says <a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/academic-hacker-news-hits-reddit-frontpage-top-of-google/">in his blog</a>, it seems to have real traction.  There goes whatever <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2196.html">productivity</a> I had left...

Meanwhile, Aran's asked for good models of what an MSc thesis should look like.  I pointed him at a couple of ACM Distinguished Dissertation winners (Ebeling's <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=7692"><em>All the Right Moves</em></a> and Gibson's <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=4290"><em>Redundant Disk Arrays</em></a> are my favorites), but (a) those are PhD-sized, and (b) they're almost as old as he is. What would <em>you</em> recommend someone model their Master's thesis on?
