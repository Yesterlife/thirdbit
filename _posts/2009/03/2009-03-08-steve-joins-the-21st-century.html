<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme">Steve Easterbrook</a>, a fellow professor in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, has started <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/">blogging</a>. His main interest these days is exploring ways software engineering researchers can help stop the planet from melting; his <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=3">first post</a> describes a panel on the topic that he's organizing at <a href="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/home/">ICSE'09</a> in Vancouver in May.
