Via Cameron Neylon and Jon Pipitone comes <a href="http://www.pachube.com/">Pachube</a>, a service that enables you to connect, tag and share real time sensor data from objects, devices, buildings and environments around the world.  Anyone want to hook this up to Twitter so I can get weather and pollution reports from arbitrary spots around the planet?
