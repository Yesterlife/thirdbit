With a bit of help from <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/">Mike Conley</a> and <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/">Adam Goucher</a>, I've exported all the posts in this blog related to the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> course and imported them into a new blog at <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/">http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/</a>.  Those of you interested in software development for science and engineering, computer-supported collaborative science, and related topics may wish to add the latter to your feeds.
