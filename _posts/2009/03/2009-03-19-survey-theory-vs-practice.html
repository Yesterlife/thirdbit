A couple of profs (one in Sweden, the other in New Zealand) have put together a <a href="http://www.sefolklore.com/welcome.html">short survey</a> to find out if programmers write code the way they've been told is <span class="style_1">The Way</span>, or do they ignore the theory and follow practices learned in the school of hard knocks.  It only takes 10 minutes, and we all might learn something.
