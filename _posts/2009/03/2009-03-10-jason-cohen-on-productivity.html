<a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/blog/double-your-productivity-without-more-work-or-stress.html">Nice post</a> from <a href="http://www.smartbear.com">SmartBear</a>'s Jason Cohen about improving productivity---or rather, about how big an improvement it is realistic to hope for.

[Subliminal message: everyone tell Jason just how much you want him to start blogging examples of great code reviews (ones he's done himself or ones he can collect from other people).  It'd be a great teaching resource, but ssh, don't tell him I suggested it.]
