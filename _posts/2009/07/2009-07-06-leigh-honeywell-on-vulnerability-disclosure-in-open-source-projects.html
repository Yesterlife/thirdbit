Leigh Honeywell (of HackLab phame) gave a talk to our students a couple of weeks about <a href="http://hypatia.ca/2009/07/vulnerability-disclosure-for-open-source-projects/">vulnerability disclosure in open source projects</a>. It's a nice introductory summary; hope you find it as useful as we did. (Note: some ISPs intermittently report "no such host" when trying to connect to her hypatia.ca domain, for reasons that are being investigated.)
