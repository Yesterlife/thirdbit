<p align="center">13th Annual Subtle Technologies Festival

Call for Submissions

Deadline January 9, 2010

Festival Dates: June 3 --- 6, 2010

This year's Subtle Technologies Festival will explore sustainability
through a critical multidisciplinary lens. We invite investigations of
the role that decentralization, diversity and societal power dynamics
play in our attempts at maintaining a sustainable future. We look forward
to exploring multiple meanings of sustainability. We will be discussing
the science and technology behind sustainable practices and design, the
science behind the events and circumstances that have driven us to seek
sustainable solutions, and the role the artist plays in deepening our
understanding of these topics.

For 12 years, Subtle Technologies has been an extremely
multi-disciplinary festival: a place where artists, scientists, and other
innovators inspire, inform and generate new concepts and tools. We
encourage submissions from any discipline relevant to sustainability.

Specifically, this year we are looking for proposals for:
<ul>
	<li>presentations for the symposium</li>
	<li>works for the exhibitions</li>
	<li>video and film submissions for screenings</li>
	<li>workshops and partners for collaborations</li>
</ul>
Some example areas of exploration in sustainability include:
<ul>
	<li>political and historical perspectives</li>
	<li>design and architectural practices</li>
	<li>global warming science</li>
	<li>climate change refugees</li>
	<li>agriculture, water and other resource management</li>
	<li>cultural preservation</li>
	<li>material science</li>
