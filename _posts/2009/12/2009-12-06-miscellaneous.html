	<li>Microsoft <a href="http://getpivot.com/">Pivot</a>: their notion of "very large data" is smaller than mine, but this is still a fascinating tool.</li>
	<li>Via <a href="http://modeling-languages.com/blog/content/free-library-datadomain-models">Jordi Cabot</a> (again), a <a href="http://databaseanswers.org/data_models/index.htm">library of data models</a> created by Barry Williams. Baseball umpire scheduling, genealogy, septic tanks, and many others, all in a uniform notation. I'll be using this in my next software engineering course.</li>
	<li>Andrey Petrov, a former student and friend (sorry, that's ambiguous, we're still friends) is co-creator of <a href="http://getupandmove.me/">Get Up and Move</a>, which lets you barter exercise with friends. "I will do pushups for 1 minute if @shazow will dance for 2 songs." Still in very early stages, but a cool idea.</li>
	<li>Mark Coleran designs <a href="http://blog.coleran.com/category/portfolio/screendesign">computer interfaces for use in movies</a>. Seriously, how cool a job is that?</li>
	<li>According to <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/12/02/open-universitys-new-introduction-to-computing/">Mark Guzdial</a>, the Open University's new "Intro to Computing" course uses JavaScript as a first language. On the one hand, cool, but on the other, it's one more reason to wish that JS had been better designed. (But note: see Mark's correction to this post in the comments.)</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">UCOSP</a> have both shown that it's easier for students to get into open source projects if there's a pile of tiny tickets for them to start with. The goal of the new <a href="https://openhatch.org/search/">OpenHatch</a> project is to collect those together by searching the raffles [1] of various projects for tickets with appropriate tags.</li>
	<li>Via <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/eclipse-4-edu-screencast/">Peter Lorimer</a>, a screencast for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZTLBSaUpg">Eclipse4Edu UCOSP project</a> showing their Scheme plugin for Eclipse. The <em>Star Wars</em> music in the background is a distracting bonus :-).</li>
	<li>Seems that a sys admin in Arizona <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2009/12/04/citizen-scientist-gone-wild-it-guy-goes-overboard-in-search-for-alien-life/">installed SETI@Home on every computer</a> in his school district. The result: 575 million hours of computer time over 9 years, costing $1.2-1.6 million in extra power consumption.</li>
</ol>
[1] Well, what else would you call something that collects a lot of tickets together?
