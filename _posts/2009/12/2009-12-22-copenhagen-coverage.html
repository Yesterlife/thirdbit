A rare upbeat analysis of <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/2009/12/21/5-fallacies-in-the-coverage-of-the-copenhagen-accord/">what happened in Copenhagen</a>.  Take it with a large grain of salt, but I agree with the author's point that the US Senate (not the White House) is the major impediment to American action.  If you're going to read it, though, you should also read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-change-mark-lynas">this angry piece</a>, from <em>The Guardian</em>'s Mark Lynas, which puts the blame for Copenhagen's failure squarely on China.
