Jason Cohen's latest post, titled "<a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/blog/youre-a-little-company-now-act-like-one.html">You're a little company, now act like one</a>", points out that a startup's first customers are going to be early adopters who like living on the edge, not big corporations that expect marketing doublespeak in web sites. He ends by saying, "Be human. Stop hiding. Be yourself." which I think is pretty good advice for anyone.
