Jon Pipitone (a graduate student in our department) recently blogged about <a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/2009/08/workshops-at-powershift-canada.html">PowerShift Canada</a>, a youth conference on climate change taking place October 23-26 in Ottawa. He'd like to know who you'd like to hear speak---if you have ideas, please drop him a line.
