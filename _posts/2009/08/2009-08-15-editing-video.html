Dear Lazyweb,

I now have <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/science20/index.html">slides</a> from the <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/guests/">symposium on Science 2.0</a> that ran as part of the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course last month. I also have video in .flv and .mov formats. I'd like to stitch the two together somehow, since the video only shows the speakers, not their slides. What's the least-effort way to do this? (Note: I have a small budget, but no experience in A/V editing, and no time to learn myself.)

Thanks,

Me
