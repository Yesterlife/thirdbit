For their thesis projects, two of my graduate students are studying what programmers actually do when developing software.  I can't give you more details than that without biasing their studies, but what I <em>can</em> tell you is that they're looking for Java coders with at least 3-4 years of full-time industry experience who'd be willing to give them an hour or so. No electrodes involved, and you'd help science move forward in a small way. If you're willing, and in the Greater Toronto Area, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">give me a shout</a> and I'll hook you up.
