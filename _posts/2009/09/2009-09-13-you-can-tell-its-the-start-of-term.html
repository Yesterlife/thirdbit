...because I'm reduced to posting links instead of thoughts:
<ul>
	<li>EtherPad's <a href="http://etherpad.com/ep/blog/posts/saving-is-obsolete">TimeSlider</a> looks very cool.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cis.uab.edu/softcom/DDF/">DSL Testing Studio</a>: I've argued for a while that testing and debugging are the Achilles' Heels of DSLs; here's some welcome progress.</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17730-new-microprocessor-runs-on-thin-air.html">microprocessor that runs on air</a>.

And some sad news: unless the Pennsylvania State Legislature acts quickly, the <a href="http://libwww.freelibrary.org/closing/">Free Library of Philadelphia will close its doors</a> in less than a month.
