Summer of Code studentships for 2009 were announced today; only one of the six projects I was involved in was accepted (Siddhant Goel's bid to extend the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysync/">PyVCAL</a> version control abstraction library).  Application numbers were down slightly from last year, but the general consensus is that the quality went up quite a bit.  Kudos to Google once again for giving so much back to the community.
