Andrew Trusty's <a href="http://pubfeed.cs.toronto.edu/">PubFeed</a> project is now on the web at http://pubfeed.cs.toronto.edu/, and he's looking for people to try it out.  PubFeed watches academic aggregators like Google Scholar for papers that meet your criteria and notifies you when they're published---think of it as "Save my query and tell me when there's a match."  Neat idea; he'd welcome feedback.
