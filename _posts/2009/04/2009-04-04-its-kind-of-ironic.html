With Google Summer of Code 2009 in full swing, I got curious: how many people have come from what schools since the program started in 2005?  (I also needed something to distract me from my cold.)  Turns out to be harder to find out than I expected---a lot harder.  The only consolidated public data I can find on past offerings is the KML map files linking mentors to students.  Unfortunately, those don't specify what schools the students are from, and there are enough inconsistencies in their formatting that I'd have to do a lot of hand-tweaking to extract even organization-project-mentor-student data.  Kind of ironic...
