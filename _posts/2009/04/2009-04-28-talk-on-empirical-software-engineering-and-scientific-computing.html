The slides for the talk I'm giving today at the NRC on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/we-know-less-than-you-think-but-we-do-know-something">empirical software engineering and how scientists actually use computers</a> are now up on SlideShare.  Weird how some graphics are messed up and others aren't, but I think it's all still readable.
