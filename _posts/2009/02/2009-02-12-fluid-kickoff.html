I discovered Jakub Linowski's "<a href="http://wireframes.linowski.ca/">Wireframes</a>" blog a few weeks ago---it's exactly the kind of thoughtful exploration of a micro-topic that I think blogging is for.  He's just announced that he's starting work on an <a href="http://wireframes.linowski.ca/?p=307">open source UI prototyping tool</a>; if you'd like to help, I'm sure he'd like to hear from you.
