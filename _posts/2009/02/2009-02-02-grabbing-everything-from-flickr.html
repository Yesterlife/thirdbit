title: "Grabbing Everything From Flickr?"

We have a paid <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account for archiving photos and sharing them with family members.  I'd like to grab everything that I've uploaded and stick it in a safe place, but Flickr doesn't provide "download all" functionality.  Neither does the open source tool <a href="http://flickrdown.sourceforge.net/">FlickrDown</a>: it only grabs photos that have been put into sets, and most of our early ones haven't.  I suppose I could look at the API docs and write something, but flippin' heck, someone must have done this already---pointers would be welcome.
