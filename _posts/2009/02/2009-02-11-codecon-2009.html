When I became a professor two and a bit years ago, I assumed that by now I'd have something to show off at conferences like <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2009/cfp.txt">CodeCon 2009</a>:
<blockquote>CodeCon is the premier showcase of cutting edge software development. It is an excellent opportunity for programmers to demonstrate their work and keep abreast of what's going on in their community.

All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally accompanied by source code. Presentations must be done by one of the active developers of the code in question. We emphasize that demonstrations be of <em>working</em> code.</blockquote>
Papers and proposals due: February 15, 2009; the conference itself is April 17-19 in San Francisco.
