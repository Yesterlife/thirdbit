We wrapped up the first half of term in my third-year software engineering class with a talk from Seth Hardy, a local computer security expert.  As always, I'm very grateful to everyone in the local tech community who's willing to give up some of their time to help bootstrap the next generation.  So thanks, Seth --- much appreciated.
