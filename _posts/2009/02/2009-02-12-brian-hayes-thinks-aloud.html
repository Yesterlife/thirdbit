Brian Hayes writes a very engaging column for <em><a href="http://www.amsci.org">American Scientist</a></em> on matters mathematical and computational. In a recent length <a href="http://bit-player.org/2009/long-division">blog post</a>, he revisits the question of finding the continental divide algorithmically.  It's a fun look at how someone thinks their way into and out of a problem.
