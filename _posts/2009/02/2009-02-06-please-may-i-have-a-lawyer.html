No, it's not what you think.  Every term for the past two years, I've brought a lawyer in to talk to my classes about intellectual property and liability issues.  The one who usually does this is unavailable this term, so I'd be grateful for an introduction to someone who (a) works in the area, and (b) is willing to do some pro bono educating.
