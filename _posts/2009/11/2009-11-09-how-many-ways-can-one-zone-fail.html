Stop me if you've heard this one... I'm at the court house waiting to find out if I'll be selected for jury duty. The only WiFi network available is <a href="http://www.onezone.ca/">OneZone</a>, but:
<ol>
	<li>The signup pages are all HTTP, not HTTPS (which means my credit card information and home address just flew threw the ether unencrypted), and</li>
	<li>Once I sign up (yeah, I did it anyway, I'm that desperate for bandwidth) the system echoes back my user ID and password on another unsecure page in plaintext.</li>
</ol>
Who <em>are</em> these people? And why are they still employed? *sigh*

<em>Later: it may be insecure, but at least it's slow...</em>
