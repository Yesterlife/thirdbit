<p>Dear lazyweb,</p>
<p>I've been handed a file with the authors and titles of approximately 140 scientific papers, and would like to construct a proper bibliography (complete with journal titles, publication dates, DOIs, etc.). If there were just 20 entries, I'd do it by hand, but with 140, I'd like some kind of script. How would you do this? It can be as <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/25/usingregularexpressionstomatchhtml.aspx#74834">ugly</a> as it needs to be...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
