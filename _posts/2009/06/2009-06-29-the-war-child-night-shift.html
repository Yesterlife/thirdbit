For the duration of the garbage strike in Toronto, the staff of <a href="http://www.warchild.ca/">War Child Canada</a> will be <a href="http://blog.ftjco.com/2009/06/25/workin-the-night-shift-for-war-child-canada/">doing pickups</a> at $10/bag or 6 for $50. All the proceeds go to helping young victims of war. Hard to think of a better cause...
