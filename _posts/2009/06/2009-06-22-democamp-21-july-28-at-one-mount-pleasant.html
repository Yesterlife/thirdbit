<a href="http://democamp.com/2009/06/22/democamp-toronto-21/">DemoCamp 21</a> has been announced: July 28, 6-9 pm in the Rogers Communications' theatre at One Mount Pleasant. Tickets will be released a few days before the event, but as David Crow says, the best way to get a spot is to <a href="http://democamp.com/submit/">apply to present</a>. Look forward to seeing you there!
