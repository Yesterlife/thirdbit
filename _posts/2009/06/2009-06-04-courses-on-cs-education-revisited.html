I asked <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2455.html">a while back</a> if anyone knew of courses or degree programs dedicated to teaching people how to teach computer science. Several people provided useful links; the one I've found most interesting is <a href="https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs106/">Stanford's CS198</a> course, in which senior undergrads help teach first-year courses. I'd really like to try something like that locally, but it would take much longer than 329 days to ste up...
