I left home when I was seventeen.
I call home almost every Sunday night,
no matter where in the world I was.
If my dad answered,
I'd ask him how he was and he'd reply by telling me about the weather
and then say,
"Anyway, I think your mother would like to talk to you."

2052 weeks passed between then and the first weekend in January,
when my mother had a stroke.
Even if I only called eight weeks out of ten,
that's still sixteen hundred conversations,
and I'm finding it a hard habit to break.
No matter what else I'm doing or what else I've done,
I get a little restless as the weekend draws to a close.
As silly as it is,
part of me hopes that I'll never get used to
not being able to call home on Sunday night.
