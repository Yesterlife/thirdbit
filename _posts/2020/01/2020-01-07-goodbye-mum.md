In the end you think about the beginning.
I remember sweaters so thick you could use them as blankets,
each one made by hand.
I remember getting blackberry pie for my birthday instead of cake
because she knew that was my favorite,
and how she would make a separate batch of hamburger patties for me
because I didn't like them with onions.
I remember her driving an hour and a half each way to night school
to get her teaching degree
while raising four kids,
and how much she enjoyed reading biographies,
and knowing that she loved me even when I thought no one else did.
I remember how much she enjoyed fresh cut flowers,
and her 70th birthday trip to San Francisco,
and pictures of her grandchildren.

Goodbye, Mum.
I know you were ready to leave,
but I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
I'm going to miss you so much.
