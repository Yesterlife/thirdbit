<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/06/18/158720.aspx"> Roy Osherove</a> posted a description of his team's whiteboard-based project management technique.  Like most "agile" technologies, it won't scale to large teams, or long-lived projects, but that isn't the space <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a> is aimed at.  I'd be grateful for links to web-based project tracking and management tools that are as simple as this...</p>
