<p>I don't often quote Ronald Reagan, but in this case, he's quoting an old Russian proverb, so I guess it's OK.  Doveryay, no proveryay: trust, but verify.  We're running a training session for the incoming <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/neon">Hippo</a> students on Saturday.  Two of the outgoing students spent some time last week installing the required software on the departmental machines, so this morning, I decided to give it a test drive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> wouldn't run---bad permissions.  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> wouldn't either---missing some shared libraries.  And I'm still trying to get <a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net">HSQLDB</a> to play nicely on my Windows machine.  The students who are helping me seem a little crestfallen, but I actually think we're doing pretty well.  You <em>always</em> run into problems like this when you're trying to set up a shared development environment.  Yesterday, for example, one of my co-workers at Hewlett-Packard and I spent an hour tracking down a problem in an <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> configuration file.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddites</a> would cite this as further proof that modern tools actually slow programmers down by hiding too much of what's Really Going On, but in my experience, a little configuration pain now and again repays itself many times over when you're actually programming.</p>

<p>But you have to verify.  You should trust your software, but you have to verify that it is doing what you think it is.  Human-readable configurations help, as do integrity-checking tools, logging tools, and all the other debugging aids that we usually don't take the time to put into the products we build.  We've made a start on this in <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/neon">Hippo</a>, but there's a lot more to do...</p>
