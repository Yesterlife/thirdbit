Budi Kurniawan and Paul Deck: How Tomcat Works.  BrainySoftware.com, 2004, 097521280X, 450 pages.

<hr />Kurniawan and Deck's How Tomcat Works is a narrower
book than some, but
seems to be driven by the universal need to make sense of things.  The book
delivers exactly what its title promises: a detailed, step-by-step
explanatio of how the world's most popular Java servlet container
works.  The authors start with a naive web server that does nothing
except serve static HTML pages until it's told to stop.  From that
humble beginning, they build up to a full-blown servlet container one
feature at a time.  Each time they add code, they explain what it's
doing, and (more importantly) _why_ it's needed.  Their English is
occasionally strained, and there were paragraphs I had to read several
times to understand, but this book is nevertheless an invaluable
resource for every servlet programmer who wants to know more about her
world.
