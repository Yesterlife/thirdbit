Godfrey Nolan: Decompiling Java.  APress, 2004, 1590592654, 264 pages.

<hr />I was excited when
I read the description of this book on APress's site, since
decompilation is one of those subjects (like debugging and linking)
that has been crying out for a good book for years.  Unfortunately,
this book isn't good: it rambles, it repeats itself, and too many of
the decompilers it references are out of date or have vanished
completely.  This isn't just the author's fault---better editing would
have made a different as well---but for now, if you want to make sense
of this particular corner of the programming world, you should look
for some other guide than this.
