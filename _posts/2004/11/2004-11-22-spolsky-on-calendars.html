<p>A little over a year ago, Joel Spolsky wrote an excellent article entitled
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>.  I've been searching the web for something as informative, and readable, on dates, times, calendrical calculations, and related mysteries.  If anyone knows of a programmer-oriented tutorial on the subject, please drop me a line (gvwilson at pyre dot you-know-what).</p>
