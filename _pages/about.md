![Greg Wilson]({{site.github.url}}/files/gvwilson-toque-2013.jpg)

I was born in 1963, and grew up on [Vancouver Island](http://www.town.lakecowichan.bc.ca/),
where two inches of rain is considered a light shower.
I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering at [Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca) in 1984,
then worked in Ottawa before moving to Edinburgh
to do an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 1985-86.
I spent the next six years working as a programmer at the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)
while doing a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I completed in 1992)
and writing popular science articles.

Between 1992 and 1995
I wrote [a book on parallel programming](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Scientific-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262231867/)
while doing post-doctoral work at several universities.
I then took a post with IBM in Toronto before joining a data visualization startup.
Between those two jobs,
I experienced many of the things that can go wrong in both large and small software teams.
On the bright side,
I co-edited
[another book on parallel programming](http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Programming-Scientific-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262731185/).

I went independent in 1998,
working primarily for [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov),
wrote [my first children's book](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Sensible-Adventures-Greg-Wilson/dp/1550375989),
and started playing the saxophone and Ultimate frisbee (though not simultaneously).
I also became involved in open source development,
particularly Python.
Between 2000 and 2004 I was part of a computer security startup
that was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard,
a contributing editor with *Doctor Dobb's Journal*,
and an adjunct professor in [Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca).

After leaving HP in 2004, I put the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) course online
and wrote [another book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974514071).
I became a professor in [Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca) in May 2007,
a post I held until April 2010.
In that time I published
[another children's book](http://www.scholastic.ca/education/movingupwithliteracyplace/popups/g5-guidedreading.html)
and two more on programming
(one of which, [*Beautiful Code*](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/),
won a Jolt Award in 2008),
supervised graduate students and Google Summer of Code projects,
set up a [cross-country undergraduate capstone project program](http://ucosp.ca/),
helped create a [Master's degree in Applied Computing](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/Graduate/prospective_gradwhy/mscac.htm),
and was named ComputerWorld Canada's "IT Educator of the Year" for 2010.
I also met the woman I'm now married to (which probably ought to have gone at the start of this paragraph),
and in 2007 we became the proud and happy parents of
the most wonderful little redhead in the whole wide world.

I left academia in 2010
and spent the next seven years building [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) into
a non-profit organization that helps thousands of researchers worldwide every year.
I also helped organize a summit meeting of grassroots groups trying to improve inclusion and diversity in the tech sector,
edited [a book on evidence-based software engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)
and [a series on software architecture](http://aosabook.org),
wrote [some more children's books](http://sensibleadventures.com/),
and turned the Software Carpentry instructor training course into
a book called [*Teaching Tech Together*](http://teachtogether.tech).

I left [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) in January 2017,
and after a brief stints with [Rangle.io](http://rangle.io)
(sponsors of the wonderful [Bridge](http://bridgeschool.io/) program)
and
[DataCamp](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup)
(which [ended badly]({{site.github.url}}/2019/04/15/an-exchange-with-datacamp.html)),
I am now in the Education group at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com),
makers of [a world-class IDE](http://rstudio.cloud) and other fine tools.
My main responsibility is [RStudio's instructor training and certification program](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers),
but my job gives me a chance to dabble in a bunch of other things,
including [a book on JavaScript for data scientists](http://js4ds.org).
