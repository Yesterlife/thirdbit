# Recommended Reading

Over the last decade,
I have belatedly realized that programmers can't understand what they ought to build
without reading other things as well.
The books below have helped me understand
just how intellectually impoverished Silicon Valley's worldview is;
if you find them useful,
I'd appreciate suggestions for additions.

This list is a partial, incomplete, and inadequate replacement for
what I hoped the "[Stuff That Actually Matters][stam]" project would produce.
What I *really* want---and what I think tech desperately needs---is
an approachable one-volume distillation of all this
along the lines of Bryson's *[A Short History of Nearly Everything][everything]*
or Conery's *[Imposter's Handbook][imposters]*.
Producing it would cost less than the launch party for a new brand of phone;
the fact that it hasn't happened is just one more sign of how desperately we need it.

1. Karen Armstrong: *[The Great Transformation][great-transformation]*.
   Chronicles the critical centuries in which Confucianism and Daoism arose in China,
   Hinduism and Buddhism in India,
   monotheism in the Middle East,
   and rationalism in Greece.

1. Jean Baker: *[Sisters: The Lives of America's Suffragists][sisters]*.
   Explains history through biography,
   and does well at both.

1. David Bollier: *[Think Like a Commoner][think-like-commoner]*.
   Explains what a commons is and why most of them aren't actually tragedies.

1. Stewart Brand: *[How Buildings Learn][hbl]*.
   One of the most practical thinkers of the 20th Century draws on his experience as an architect
   to explain how many other things in our society come to be as they are.

1. Alex Butterworth: *[The World That Never Was][anarchists]*.
   Explores the early days of the anarchist movement,
   and in doing so shows how governments create the villains they need.

1. Matthew Crawford: *[Shop Class as Soulcraft][shop-class]*.
   There are truths about ourselves we can only learn
   by interacting with things that cannot be swayed or bargained with.

1. Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh: *[Trick or Treatment][trick-treatment]*.
   A sceptical (but not hostile) look at alternative medicine
   that is incidentally a great primer on standards of evidence
   and how to interpret scientific findings.

1. Peter Frase: *[Four Futures][four-futures]*.
   Explores four scenarios in which our reactions to increasing automation and worsening climate change
   play out.

1. Elizabeth Green: *[Building a Better Teacher][babt]*.
   Why educational reforms in the United States and elsewhere have foundered,
   and what other countries have done instead that's worked.

1. Adam Hochschild: *[Bury the Chains][chains]*.
   "Slavery was to the nineteenth century what oil is today:
   morally repugnant but economically indispensible."
   And the fight against it was one of the first great triumphs of democratic activism.

1. Jennifer Hecht: *[Doubt: A History][doubt]*.
   Traces the evolution of one of the great traditions in Western thought
   (one which even today makes many people uncomfortable).

1. Sarah Kendzior: *[The View From Flyover Country][flyover]*.
   Essential reading about the rise of authoritarian kleptocracy in the United States.

1. Andro Linklater: *[Owning the Land][owning-land]*.
   The idea that individuals can own land is a lot younger than most people realize,
   and its emergence holds a lot of lessons for today's debates over intellectual property.

1. Samuel Moyn: *[The Last Utopia][last-utopia]*.
   Argues that human rights became the defining issue for post-war progressives
   only because others failed.

1. George Orwell: *[Essays][orwell]*.
   The best writing from the best political writer (in English) of the 20th Century.

1. Pankaj Mishra: *[From the Ruins of Empire][empire]*.
   Three intellectual biographies showing how the peoples of Asia have responded to the West.

1. Jim Stanford: *[Economics for Everyone][economics-everyone]*.
   A useful antidote to the abstract, unquestioning way that neoliberal economics is usually presented.

1. Zeynep Tufekci: *[Twitter and Tear Gas][twitter-tear-gas]*.
   A nuanced look at how social media is and isn't changing politics and protest.

1. Susan Whitfield: *[Life Along the Silk Road][silk-road]*.
   A history of Central Asia told in twelve biographies.

1. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett: *[The Spirit Level][spirit-level]*.
   An evidence-based exploration of how and why greater equality is better for everyone.

## A Few Others

These are wonderful books,
but don't have any overt politic overtones.

1. Hope Jahren: *[Lab Girl][lab-girl]*.
   An unflinching and beautifully-written account of a life in science. 

1. David George Haskell: *[The Forest Unseen][forest-unseen]*.
   A peaceful, inspiring meditation on one square meter of old growth forest
   through the course of a year.

1. Tracy Kidder: *[The Soul of a New Machine][soul-machine]*.
   The best book ever written about computing's Silver Age.

1. Siddhartha Mukherjee: *[The Emperor of All Maladies][emperor-maladies]*.
   A history of cancer and its (mis)treatment,
   and of the people it has touched.

1. Charles Petzold: *[The Annotated Turing][annotated-turing]*.
   A line-by-line exegesis of Turing's most famous paper,
   full of illuminating insights into the Golden Age of computing.

1. Ellen Ullman: *[Life in Code][life-code]*.
   The second volume in the author's personal history of computing's Bronze Age.

1. James Ward: *[Adventures in Stationery][stationery]*.
   A wonderful quirky book about everyday things---probably the most British entry in this list.

1. Jonathan Weiner: *[Time, Love, Memory][tlm]*.
   A great description of how science is actually done,
   and of what it's like to have a life in science.
