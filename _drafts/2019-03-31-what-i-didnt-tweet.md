-   [This](https://flourish.studio/2019/02/07/audio-talkie-visualisation-data-stories/)
    is *so* close to [Browsercast](http://third-bit.com/browsercast/).

-   "The true purpose of unpaid internships is to turn private wealth into professional credentials."
    - Sarah Kendzior.

    requiring candidates to scrub all unpaid internships from their CVs
    when applying for jobs.)
