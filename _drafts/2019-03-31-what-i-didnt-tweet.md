title: "What I Didn't Tweet in March"
---

-   [The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing so many people that he needs an advocate.](https://twitter.com/Shakestweetz/status/1107740466123079681)

-   *[The Gutter Prayer](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/gareth-hanrahan/the-gutter-prayer/9780316525305/)* is a damn good read.

-   At this point I think we all know that Trump/Kushner/et al are going to be America's
    [Philby, Burgess, and Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five);
    the big difference will be that this lot betrayed their country out of greed,
    not out of conviction.

-   [This](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/economy/gig-economy-lobbying.html) is what the "free market" looks like up close:
    billionaires getting rules rewritten to make themselves richer at everyone else's expense.

-   "The true purpose of unpaid internships is to turn private wealth into professional credentials."
    - Sarah Kendzior.
    (I hope that one day there will be a movement to ask companies to sign a public pledge
    requiring candidates to scrub all unpaid internships from their CVs
    when applying for jobs.)

-   [This](https://flourish.studio/2019/02/07/audio-talkie-visualisation-data-stories/)
    is *so* close to [Browsercast](http://third-bit.com/browsercast/).
    We'll get there some day...

-   I really want someone to make earbuds that clip onto the arms of my glasses
    so I don't have to jam them in my ears to keep them in place.

-   Half of the children in my daughter's grade 6 class believe that vaccines cause autism :-(

-   *Fringe* was a better show than we deserved.

-   Again: if your solution to problem X is "more funding" and you don't have a plan for getting more funding,
    you're not solving the problem, you're just flapping your gums.

-   I asked Packt if they would publish material that is Creative Commons licensed.
    They refused to answer the question until I'd signed up with them.

-   [What Happened to the *Star Wars* That I Used to Know?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJlbPXZEpRE)

-   *[1912](https://www.amazon.com/1912-Roosevelt-Debs-Election-Changed/dp/0743273559/)* taught me a lot I didn't know,
    and seems pretty relevant today.
    Also, anyone who really believed in a free market would have broken up Amazon under anti-monopoly laws long ago.

-   "Dude, I kind of want to camp out until the anvils start falling" is not an unusual statement in our house.

-   My to-read list is down to 109 papers and a 900-page book.

-   Our prime minister may be a crook,
    but [I'm still proud to be Canadian](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/family-asylum-snowden-canada-1.5070571).

-   Except when we do [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47701221).

-   Just registered for [ICSE 2019](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/).
    Form asked me to pick 2--3 areas of interest out of 15.
    "Education" wasn't one of the options.

-   Honestly, I think I'm more of a [cautionary tale](https://twitter.com/sail_lab/status/1111662823090868224).
