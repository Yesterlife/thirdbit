-   [This](https://flourish.studio/2019/02/07/audio-talkie-visualisation-data-stories/)
    is *so* close to [Browsercast](http://third-bit.com/browsercast/).
    We'll get there some day...

-   "The true purpose of unpaid internships is to turn private wealth into professional credentials."
    - Sarah Kendzior.
    (I hope that one day there will be a movement to ask companies to sign a public pledge
    requiring candidates to scrub all unpaid internships from their CVs
    when applying for jobs.)

-   At this point I think we all know that Trump/Kushner/et al are going to be America's
    [Philby, Burgess, and Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five);
    the big difference will be that this lot betrayed their country out of greed,
    not out of conviction.

-   [The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing so many people that he needs an advocate.](https://twitter.com/Shakestweetz/status/1107740466123079681)

-   Half of the children in my daughter's grade 6 class believe that vaccines cause autism.

-   Again: if your solution to problem X is "more funding" and you don't have a plan for getting more funding,
    you're not solving the problem, you're just flapping your gums.

-   I asked Packt if they publish material that is Creative Commons licensed.
    They didn't seem to understand the question.
