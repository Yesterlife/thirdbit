title: "What I Didn't Tweet in April"

-   If a handful of major universities change their rules so that
    people can only include open access articles in their packages
    when they apply for positions, promotion, or tenure,
    paywalled research will be a thing of the past in approximately nineteen seconds.

-   In practice I think tenure protects [wrongdoing](https://twitter.com/JillHicksKeeton/status/1113552872128385024)
    more often than it does free speech.

-   [This thread](https://twitter.com/alilleybrinker/status/1113538427855757313) from Andrew Lilley Brinker
    is a must-read:
    the distinction he makes between techno-libertarians and techno-structuralists is really useful,
    and if
    *[Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code]({{site.github.url}}/ideas/#sex-and-drugs-and-guns-and-code-what-everyone-in-tech-needs-to-know-about-politics-economics-and-power)*
    ever materializes,
    I hope it will help the former realize why the latter is a more useful way to view the world.

-   And [this thread](https://twitter.com/SuzyHobbsBaker/status/1113146475750600710) from Suzy Hobbs Baker
    is equally useful as a summary of how to make change happen.
