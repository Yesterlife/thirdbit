-   "Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised." - Michael Scott

-   Fascism (n.): treating people the way Apple treats your music collection.

-   CS1 is not the whole of computing education.

-   You can stop paying attention to anyone who gives Steve Bannon or Jordan Peterson the time of day
    and not miss anything that matters.

-   Also anyone who thinks we can revolutionize education with blockchain,
    because unfortunately <{{site.github.url}}/2012/06/29/those-who-ignore-history.html> never gets old.

-   LaaaaaaTeeeeeeXxxxxx...

-   I could really use a guide to pronouncing accented characters in various languages.

-   `git push origin hamster` over and over again...

-   The ACM's version of "open" and "welcoming" is,
    you can't subscribe to the RSS feed for new articles in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education*
    unless you create an account and log in:

-   Faaaaaactoooorrrssss...

-   It has been 0 days since our last kitchen incident.

-   Shopify is still helping Breitbart, Rebel Media, and other white nationalist rage sites stay in business.
    [Johnathan Nightingale](https://twitter.com/johnath/status/1090043751291109378) asks
    why people who would rather we didn't keep drawing attention to that
    aren't also leaning on Shopify.
    I wonder sometimes if the people who work there ever let themselves feel guilty about
    [the harm they're helping those sites do](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/conspiracy-theories-internet-survivors-truth).
    I suspect not, and that thought wearies me.

-   I still can't listen to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" without wanting to cry.

-   And don't even talk to me about Cat Stevens' "Father and Son".

-   I am old enough to be concerned about the lyrics in the music my daughter listens to.

-   I sometimes choose names for files and directories so that when I do `ls`, the names in each column will be the same length.
    Then I add one thing and have to go through and rename everything after it in the alphabet to make stuff line up properly again.

-   I am starting to sag in places where I didn't even used to have saggable bits.

-   Coincidence? Perhaps:

-   Grief and depression are very different things.

-   Try to find something in your life that makes you feel [like Cassandra Wilson sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB1HK-rlVig).
