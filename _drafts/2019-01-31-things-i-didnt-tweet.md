-   [Not on the Shelves (2019 Edition)]({{site.github.url}}/2019/01/06/not-on-the-shelves-2019.html)

-   [Leadership Training for Open Science]({{site.github.url}}/2019/01/10/leadership-training-for-open-science..html)

-   [The Principle of Least Precision]({{site.github.url}}/2019/01/24/principle-of-least-precision.html)

-   "Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised." - Michael Scott

-   "I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better." - Maya Angelou

-   Fascism (n.): treating people the way Apple treats your music collection.

-   CS1 is not the whole of computing education.

-   You can stop paying attention to anyone who gives Steve Bannon or Jordan Peterson the time of day
    and not miss anything that matters.

-   Also anyone who thinks we can revolutionize education with blockchain,
    because unfortunately <{{site.github.url}}/2012/06/29/those-who-ignore-history.html> never gets old.

-   LaaaaaaTeeeeeeXxxxxx...

-   I could really use a guide to pronouncing various accented characters in various languages.

-   `git push origin hamster` over and over again...

-   You can't subscribe to the *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* RSS feed that tells you
    what new papers have been published unless you create an account and log in.

-   I almost reactivated my Twitter account to +1 [this tweet by Dave Beazley](https://twitter.com/dabeaz/status/1081268555721699329).

-   Faaaaaactoooorrrssss...

-   Please stop saying, "We need to fix X" unless you are actively working on it, because if you're not, your "we need to" is just a "[someone ought to]({{site.github.url}}/2011/05/28/you-doesnt-exist.html)".

-   It has been 0 days since our last kitchen incident.

-   I still can't listen to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" without feeling like I want to cry.  Or Cat Stevens' "Father and Son".

-   I am old enough to be concerned about the lyrics in the music my daughter listens to.

-   I sometimes choose names for files and directories so that when I do `ls`, the names in each column will be the same length.  Then I add one thing and have to go through and rename everything after it in the alphabet to make stuff line up properly again.

-   I am starting to sag in places where I didn't even used to have saggable bits.

-   Reminder: Shopify is still helping Breitbart, Rebel Media, and other populist rage sites stay in business.  Are the people who work there proud of [what they've helped those sites achieve](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-supreme-court-transgender-military-ban-1.4987798)?  Do they think about [the lives they've helped destroy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/conspiracy-theories-internet-survivors-truth)?  Or do they just not think about it?
