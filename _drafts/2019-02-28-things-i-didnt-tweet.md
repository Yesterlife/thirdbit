-   [Classifying Data]({{site.github.url}}/2019/02/04/classifying-data.html)

-   [Libraries Tell It Like It Is]({{site.github.url}}/2019/02/05/libraries-tell-it-like-it-is.html)

-   Of the 53 names on the list of instructors and helpers for upcoming Carpentry workshops on February 1,
    I knew 8.

-   Saying, "If you need to comment your code, you should write clearer code,"
    is like saying, "If you need to use English in your proof, you should write clearer formulas."

-   I would really like stats on authors' genders for various tech publishers.

-   "I have a love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe.
    If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." -- Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*

-   "When people talk about traveling to the past, they worry about radically changing the present by doing something small,
    but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically change the future by doing something small."

-   "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain
    than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."
    -- Stephen Jay Gould

-   I'm no good at writing villains.

-   [Rebel Against the Kings of Babylon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ge7j5wyVvo)

-   I really enjoyed Weinstein et al's *[Understanding How We Learn](http://www.learningscientists.org/book)*;
    I hope that one day we'll know enough about the psychology of programming
    that someone will be able to write *Understanding How We Code*.

-   I almost re-enabled my Twitter account so that I could re-tweet [this](https://twitter.com/SlacktivistFred/status/1096165930365796357).
