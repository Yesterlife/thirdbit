title: "Things I Didn't Tweet This Month"

-   Of the 53 names on the list of instructors and helpers for upcoming Carpentry workshops on February 1,
    I knew 8.

-   Saying, "If you need to comment your code, you should write clearer code,"
    is like saying, "If you need to use English in your proof, you should write clearer formulas."

-   I would really, really like a breakdown of the proportion of authors of various genders
    who have done books with various tech publishers.

-   "I have a love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe.
    If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." -- Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*

-   "When people talk about traveling to the past, they worry about radically changing the present by doing something small,
    but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically change the future by doing something small."

-   "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain
    than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."
    -- Stephen Jay Gould

-   With apologies to [Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge),
    I believe that all data sets can be classified as follows:
    1.  Those that belong to the emperor.
    2.  Those that are irrelevant.
    3.  Those that are presently empty.
    4.  Those that describe tulips.
    5.  Those that are included in this classification.
    6.  Those that make analysts tremble as if they were mad.
    7.  Those originally written on parchment with a fine camel hair brush.
    8.  Screenshots of spreadsheets embedded in PDFs.
    9.  Those containing the word "NULL".
    10. Those that include the only copy of the API key needed to access them.
    11. Those that when plotted at low resolution appear to be distributed normally.
    12. Those with indisputable provenance.
    13. Those whose columns are of monotonically increasing width.
    14. This one.
