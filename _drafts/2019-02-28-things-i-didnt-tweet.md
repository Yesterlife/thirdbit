-   [Greenspun's Eleventh Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule):

-   I really enjoyed *[Understanding How We Learn](http://www.learningscientists.org/book)*;
    I hope that one day we'll know enough about the psychology of programming
    that someone will be able to write *Understanding How We Code*.

-   We're not going to get "CS for All" unless we get a straight-up decent education for all,

-   "I have a love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe.
    If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." -- Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*

    but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically change the future by doing something small."

-   "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain
    than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."
    -- Stephen Jay Gould

-   [This tweet](https://twitter.com/juliansimioni/status/1086289665194217472) pretty much sums it up.
