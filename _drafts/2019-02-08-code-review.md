title: "Examples Wanted for Code Review"
---

There's a lot of good advice on the web about how to do code reviews,
from Cohen et al's *[Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review](https://smartbear.com/resources/ebooks/best-kept-secrets-of-code-review/)*
to [articles](https://hackernoon.com/code-reviews-8c496601b9a9)
[like](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/unlearning-toxic-behaviors-in-a-code-review-culture-b7c295452a3c)
[these](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)
[ones]( https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/).
What *isn't* there are curated examples that will speak to novices,
particularly novices who think of themselves as scientists first and programmers second.
The code in projects like [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
or [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) is more complex than what most data scientists write
(after all, the whole purpose of those libraries is to hide complexity)
so novices can easily find pull requests in those repositories a little intimidating.
They would probably find feedback on two-page submissions in college-level courses more useful,
but most of those aren't public,
and the feedback is often on the statistics rather than on the code.

As part of putting together a tutorial on code review for aspiring data scientists,
I would be grateful for pointers to publicly-available examples of one- or two-page programs
in R or Python
that include the kinds of redundancies, clumsy workarounds, and outright mistakes
that novices frequently make.
I realize it's asking a lot---it's uncomfortable to have the whole world watch you stumble---but
I think that a dozen examples with some accompanying explanation
will do a lot more to help novices figure out what they should look for and what they should say about it
than all the general principles in the world.
