</h3>

<p>
  Many people offer utopian or dystopian visions of a world transformed by
  computing. In this talk, we present something more modest but more achievable:
  a world in which normal people can analyze data and collaborate at scale
  without heroic effort.  We also present a roadmap for getting there, one which
  involves making statistical methods and the use of advanced tools the twin
  engines of software engineering education.

</h3>

<p>
  Since its start in 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a week-long
  training course at the US national laboratories into a worldwide volunteer
  effort to improve researchers' computing skills. This talk explores the
  lessons we've learned along the way about applying open source software
  development techniques to teaching at scale, and about getting people and
  institutions to change the way they work.

  <a href="{{site.github.url}}/talks/lesson-design/">How to Design an Effective Lesson</a>
</h3>

<p>
  Having tried to cram a dozen books about teaching into a two-day
  course, I have now tried to cram key ideas from that course about
  designing effective lessons into this one-hour talk.

  <a href="{{site.github.url}}/talks/greatest-hits/">Software Engineering's Greatest Hits</a>
</h3>

<p>
  Software engineering is in the process of turning itself into an
  evidence-based research discipline.  This talk describes how that is
  happening, why it matters, and a few of the more interesting,
  surprising, and controversial results to date.

</h3>

<p>
  Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the
  market, but there are only three about writing debuggers.  Everyone
  thinks we should teach children how to program, but undergraduate
  courses on computing education are practically nonexistent.  This
  talk explores what these gaps and others in undergraduate Computer
  Science courses tell us about the state of computing today, and
  about how we could fix it.
